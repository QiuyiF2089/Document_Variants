If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I-a(12) above, the Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul will review the video to determine: (1) Whether the defender was inside or outside the restricted area. (2) Whether the defender was in a legal guarding position. (3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. m. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I-a(13) above, the Replay Center Official would review the video in accordance with Rule 11 Section I. The Replay Center Official and on-court officials(s) may also review the video to determine only the following other matters: (1) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim, whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation. For purposes of this review, the Replay Center Official will look only at the position of the shooter’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the shot and the flight of the ball. (2) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim, whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter’s hand. (3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. n. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I-a(14) above, the Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul will review the video to determine: (1) Whether the shot clock expired before the foul occurred. (2)Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the player was fouled. (3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. o. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I-a(15) above, the Replay Center Official would review the video in accordance with Rule 12A—Section III. The Replay Center Official and on-court official(s) may also review the video to determine whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. p. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I-b(1), the Replay Center Official will immediately review the video to determine the following issues: (1) Whether the successful field goal was scored correctly as a 2-point or 3-point field goal.",
    "56": "- 56 -(2) Whether the shooter fouled was attempting a 2-point or 3-point field goal. The Replay Center Official will also review the video to determine only the following other matters: (3) Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation or the ball touched out-of-bounds prior to entering the basket or, in the case of a foul, whether the player fouled committed a boundary line violation. For purposes of this review, the Replay Center OfficiaZ will look only at the position of the player’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the shot or the foul (as applicable). (4) Whether the shot clock expired before the ball left the shooter’s hand or the foul occurred. The Replay Center Official’s review must take place within the same time constraints set forth in Section II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers))-f(1) above. q. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I-b(2) above, the Replay Center Official will immediately review the video to determine whether time on the shot clock expired before the ball left the shooter’s hand. The Replay Center Official may also review the video to determine only the following other matters: (1) If the shot was timely, whether the successful field goal was scored correctly as a 2-point or 3-point field goal. (2) Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation or the ball touched out of bounds prior to entering the basket. For purposes of this review, the Replay Center Official will look only at the position of the player’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the shot or the foul (as applicable). (3) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter’s hand or the player was fouled. The Replay Center Official’s review must take place within the same time constraints set forth in Section II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers))-h(1) above. Section III—Replay Review Process a. Except as set forth in Rule 14 below, replay reviews will be triggered by the on-court game officials and Replay Center Official in accordance with the rules set forth in Section I above. The Replay Center Official will determine the final outcome on all replays triggered pursuant to Section I above except Flagrant Fouls and Altercations, which will be decided by the on-court officials, with personnel in the Replay Center playing a supporting role. In all cases, the two game officials will inform both team benches that the play will be reviewed. For replay reviews to be determined by the Replay Center Official, the calling official, and the crew chief at his/her discretion, will go to the scorer’s table and put on the headset to receive the ruling from the Replay Center Official and the other on-court official(s) will prepare the players to return to play. If the ruling is to be made by the on-court officials, the crew chief and a second official will go to the scorer’s table and make the ruling with the assistance of the Replay Center Official. The third official will monitor the benches. b. Replay reviews should be conducted within two minutes. Notwithstanding this general rule, discretion will be used to extend the review period as reasonably necessary under unusual circumstances, such as when the play could lead to an ejection (e.g., flagrant fouls/penalty 2), technical issues arise with the replay system, the outcome of the replay review requires multiple replay review angles or additional angles are imminent. In addition, replay reviews of Player Altercations should be concluded within whatever time is reason- ably necessary , even if that time period extends beyond two minutes.",
    "57": "- 57 -c. If the replay system is not functioning properly , or not available, the officials will use the nearest courtside broadcast production TV monitor available. d. The Replay Center Official will use the following to make his/her ruling in the order listed below regarding scoring, timing or fouls at the end of any period: (1) Game clock or shot clock on top of backboard (2) LED lights (3) Game clock on the facades of the balcony (4) Game clock on score boards hanging from the ceiling (5) Superimposed TV clocks EXCEPTION (Exception (rule terminology for exceptions)): For clock malfunctions mhen clocks start early, late or freeze—the Replay Center Official will use the digital clock in the Replay Center to make the final ruling. e. The officials will keep both teams on the court at the end of the second period if replay is being used to determine if a foul was called prior to expiration of the period or if there is any question whether the shooter committed a shot clock violation, 8-second violation or boundary line violation where time may be added to the game clock. f. The officials will keep both teams on the court anytime replay is used at the end of the fourth period or overtime period. RULE NO. 14—COACH’S CHALLENGE Section I—Overview a. A head coach may trigger instant replay review of certain events subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this rule. Instant replay review triggered pursuant to this rule shall be referred to as a “Coach’s Challenge” (or “Challenge” for short). b. Each team is entitled to one Challenge throughout the entire game (regardless of whether the Challenge is successful). c. A team may utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of only the following three events: (1) a called personal foul charged to its own team, (2) a called out-of-bounds violation, or (3) a called goaltending or basket interference violation;provided that, in the last two minutes of the fourth period and last two minutes of any overtime, a team is no longer able to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a called out-of-bounds violation, or called goaltending or basket interference violation, as review of these events during these periods will be exclusively triggered by the on-court game officials. NOTE: Notwithstanding the above, the Official NBA (National Basketball Association) Playing Rules have been modified for the 2021-22 NBA (National Basketball Association) season (on a one-year trial basis) to (i) eliminate referee-initiated instant replay review of out-of-bounds violations during the last two minutes of the fourth period and the last two minutes of any overtime period; and (ii) extend the Coach’s Challenge so teams may trigger replay review of out-of-bounds violations throughout the entire game. Accordingly, a Coach’s Challenge is the only mechanism to trigger replay review of out-of-bounds violations at any point during the game. d. Any called foul, violation, or other decision by the game officials not listed in Section I-c above, or any non-call, is not a challengeable event. For clarity, instant replay review of the following events, among others, may not be triggered by a Challenge: (1) a called personal foul charged to the opposing team, (2) continuation—e.g., whether a defensive foul occurred prior to the offensive player beginning his shooting motion, (3) a Technical Foul or Flagrant Foul, and (4) violations such as traveling, carrying, double dribble, or an offensive or defensive three- seconds. As set forth in Section II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers))-b(3) below, any aspect related to continuation constitutes a reviewable matter when a called foul is properly challenged, but continuation is not by itself an independent challengeable event.",
    "58": "- 58 -Section II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers))—Procedure to Initiate the Challenge a. To initiate a Challenge, the challenging team must take the following steps in sequence: (1) The challenging team must call a legal timeout immediately after the call in question (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is already underway); (2) The challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for a Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal (i.e., twirling an index finger) toward the game official(s) during the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the timeout was called or, if the timeout was called by a player on the challenging team, the challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for the Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game officials as the game official is notifying the scorekeeper of the timeout; and (3) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging team’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must notify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging. For purposes of this rule only, “immediately” shall mean that a timeout is called prior to the ball being given to the thrower-in, the ball being given to the free throw shooter, or the ball being tossed on a jump ball, whichever is applicable (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is already underway). b. To initiate a Challenge of an event that immediately preceded a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team, no later than 30 seconds from the start of the timeout (as measured by the timeout clock), the challenging team’s head coach must take the following steps in sequence: (1) Signal for a Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game officials; and (2) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging team’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must notify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging. c. In the event the game officials conference to determine the call on the floor (and, as a result, the final ruling on the play is unknown for a period of time), the window of time within which a team must immediately challenge the call starts after the officials notify the negatively affected team of the final ruling on the play. The negatively affected team’s window to challenge the final ruling on the play ends when the ball is given to the inbounder or free throw shooter, jump-ball is tossed, or 30 seconds after the team has been notified of thefinal ruling on the play in the event that a mandatory timeout or timeout by the opposing team has been called (whichever is applicable). d. A team loses its opportunity to challenge the prior call if it is called for a delay-of-game after the call in question but prior to calling timeout and simultaneously signaling for a Challenge. e. Once instant replay review is triggered by a valid Challenge, the official will notify the official scorer of the Challenge. The official scorer shall immediately record the Challenge and, once the instant replay review process is complete, thT outcome of the Challenge (including whether the Challenge resulted in a loss of one timeout for the challenging team). Section III—Reviewable Matters a. If an instant replay review of a called foul is triggered by a Challenge, the on-court crew chief will review the video to evaluate whether the foul being challenged was correctly called. The on-court crew chief may also review the video to determine only the following other matters:",
    "59": "- 59 -(1) Whether the correct player (including a player on the opposing team) was called for the foul; (2) Whether a different foul proximate to the called foul should have been called; (3) Any aspect related to continuation, including, but not limited to: (a) Whether the foul occurred prior to the offensive player beginning his shooting motion if the foul is committed by a defensive player; (b) Whether a made basket that the on-court game officials counted shall not count because an offensive player committed a violation after the offensive player gathered the ball; and (c) Whether a made basket disallowed by the on-court game officials shall count because the shot constituted legal continuation. (4) Whether a goaltending or basket interference violation occurred on the play; (5) Whether the game clock expired prior to the foul; (6) Whether the shot clock expired prior to the foul; (7) If an offensive player was fouled while in possession of the ball, whether the player who was fouled committed a boundary line violation either just prior to or after the foul; (8) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the player was fouled; and (9) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. NOTE: For purposes of Section III-a(2) above, the factors that will be considered in determining whether a prior uncalled foul is proximate to the called foul include (1) whether the players involved in the uncalled foul are the same or different players than the ones involved in the called foul under review, (2) the distance between the uncalled foul and the called foul under review, and (3) the time elapsed between the uncalled foul and the called foul under review. b. If an instant replay review of an out-of-bounds violation is triggered by a Challenge, the Replay Center Official will review the video to evaluate whether the out-of-bounds violation was correctly called. The Replay Center Official may also review the video to determine only the following other matters: (1) Whether the game clock expired prior to the ball being out-of-bounds; (2) Whether the shot clock expired prior to the ball being out-of-bounds; (3) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred prior to the ball being out-of- bounds; (4) How much time remains in the period and/or on the shot clock; (5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred; and (6) If the out-of-bounds violation called fn the floor is overturned and that call occurred simultaneous to a successful shot attempt by the offensive player, whether the whistle sounded before or after the player started his shooting motion (See Rule No. 14—Section VI). c. If an instant replay review of a goaltending or basket interference violation is triggered by a Challenge, the Replay Center Official will review the video to evaluate whether the call on the floor was correct. The Replay Center Official may also review the video to determine only the following other matters:",
    "60": "- 60 -(1) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim, whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation; provided that, for purposes of this review, the Replay Center Official will look only at the position of the shooter’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the shot and the flight of the ball; (2) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim, whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter’s Xand; and (3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. Section IV (Roman numeral for 4 (used for sections or rule numbers))—Replay Review Process a. The on-court crew chief will determine the final outcome when instant replay review of a called foul is triggered by a Challenge, with personnel in the Replay Center playing a supporting role. b. The Replay Center Official will determine the final outcome when instant replay review of a called out-of-bounds violation or called goaltending or basket interference violation is triggered by a Challenge. EXCEPTION (Exception (rule terminology for exceptions)): For pre-season or regular season games conducted outside an NBA (National Basketball Association) arena, the on-court crew chief will determine the final outcome of any replay review triggered by a Challenge. c. To overturn a challenged event or to change the outcome of a reviewable matter via a Challenge, there must be clear and conclusive visual evidence that the initial adjudication of that aspect of the play was incorrect. d. Once the instant replay review process is triggered by a Challenge, the on-court crew chief or Replay Center Official (as appropriate) shall arrive at one of two determinations with respect to the call that was challenged: (1) The call stands (i.e., there is not clear and conclusive visual evidence that the call was incorrect); or (2) The call is overturned (i.e., there is clear and conclusive visual evidence that the call was incorrect). Section V—Impact on Timeouts a. If the call subject to review pursuant to a Challenge is not overturned, the Challenge is deemed unsuccessful and the challenging team loses its timeout. b. If the call subject to review pursuant to a Challenge is overturned, the Challenge is deemed successful and the challenging team retains its timeout unless the timeout taken in conjunction with the Challenge initiated a mandatory timeout. If a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge shall only be deemed successful if the called foul is overturned (i.e., not assigned to the player who was originally called for the foul) because the review results in either: (1) No foul assigned to any player (including if the foul was overturned because a reviewable violation occurred prior to the foul); or (2) A foul assigned to a different player (including a different player on the challenging team). If a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge shall be deemed unsuccessful if the foul remains assigned to the player originally called for the foul regardless of whether any other reviewable matters are changed to the challenging team’s",
    "61": "- 61 -benefit. For the sake of clarity, it shall be deemed an unsuccessful Challenge if a called foul is not overturned but changed from a shooting foul (that would have resulted in free throws for the opposing team) to a non-shooting foul (that does not result in free throws for the opposing team). c. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that immediately preceded the challenging team’s mandatory timeout, the challenging team will lose its mandatory timeout (even if the Challenge is successful). If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will only be charged one timeout (i.e., it will not be charged a timeout for both the mandatory timeout and the Challenge). d. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that preceded the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the team that is ultimately charged with the timeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful: (1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout and, notwithstanding that the Challenge coincided with the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout (and, if another mandatory timeout is remaining in the period, the next mandatory timeout will be assigned to the opposing team); and (2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout and the opposing team will be charged with the timeout. e. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that preceded a timeout called by the opposing team, the team that is ultimately charged with the timeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful: (1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout and, notwithstanding that the opposing team initially called the timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout; and (2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout and the opposing team will be charged with the timeout. f. If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event when that team has no remaining timeouts, no Challenge will take place, and that tJam shall be charged with an excessive timeout, for which the penalty is a Technical Foul. g. If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay of an event that may not be reviewed, the team will be charged a timeout but retain its Challenge. SectionVI—Resumption of Play If a Challenge results in the call on the floor being overturned following instant replay review, play is resumed at the point of interruption. For purposes of this rule only, the point of interruption is where the ball is located when the whistle sounds; provided that: (1) If the defensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a defensive foul that occurred after an offensive player started his shooting motion on a successful shot attempt, and the defensive foul itself is overturned after the replay review, the basket shall count (regardless of when the whistle sounded) and the defensive team is awarded the ball to start the next possession; and (2) If the offensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an out- of-bounds violation that occurred simultaneous to a successful shot attempt by the offensive player and the whistle sounded after the offensive player started his shooting motion, and the out-of-bounds violation is overturned after replay review, the basket shall count and the defensive team is awarded the ballto start the next possession.",
    "62": "- 62 -COMMENTS ON THE RULES I. GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRA TION AND APPLICA TION OF THE RULES Each official should have a definite and clear conception of their overall responsibilities. It is essential for them to know , understand and implement the rules as intended. If all officials possess the same conception there will be a guaranteed uniformity in the administration of all contests. The restrictions placed upon the player by the rules are intended to create a balance of play , equal opportunity for the defense and the offense, provide reasonable safety and protection for all players and emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom of action of player or team. The purpose of penalties is to compensate a player who has been placed at a disadvantage through an illegal act of an opponent and to restrain players from committing acts which, if ignored, might lead to roughness even though they do not affect the immediate play . II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers)). BASIC PRINCIPLES A. CONTACT SITUATIONS 1. Incidental Contact The mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which isincidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a player attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to perform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this position. The hand is considered “part of the ball” when it is in contact with the ball. Therefore, contact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal. 2. Guarding an Opponent In all guarding situationsX a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires, provided he legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent. If a defensive or offensive player has established a position on the floor and his opponent initiates contact that results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY . During all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed to take a position between his man and the basket. A player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an opponent provided he is not moving directly or obliquely toward his opponent when contact occurs. A player is never permitted to move into the path of an opponent after the opponent has started his upward jumping motion. A player who extends a hand, forearm, shoulder, hip or leg into the path of an opponent and thereby causes contact is not considered to have a legal position in the path of an opponent. A player is entitled to a vertical position even to the extent of jumping straight-up or holding his arms above his shoulders, as in post play or when double-teaming in pressing tactics.",
    "63": "- 63 -Any player who conforms to the above is absolved from responsibility for any contact by an opponent which may dislodge or tend to dislodge such player from the position which he has attained and is maintaining legally . If contact occurs, the official must decide whether the contact is incidental or a foul has been committed. 3. Screening When a player screens in front of or at the side of a stationary opponent, he may be as close as he desires providing he does not make contact. His opponent can see him and, there- fore, is expected to detour around the screen. If he screens behind a stationary opponent, the opponent must be able to take a normal step backward without contact. Because the opponent is not expected to see a screener behind him, the player screened is given latitude of movement. The defender must be given an opportunity to change direction and avoid contact with the screener. T o screen a moving opponent, the player must stop soon enough to permit his opponent the opportunity to avoid contact. The distance between the player screening and his opponent will depend upon the speed at which the players are moving. If two opponents are moving in the same direction and path, the player who is behind is responsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow his pace, but he may not move backward or sideward into his opponent. The player in front may or may not have the ball. This situation assumes the two players have been moving in identically the same direction and path before contact. 4. The Dribble If the dribbler’s path is blocked, he is expected to pass or shoot; that is, he should not try to dribble by an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without contact. B. FOULS: FLAGRANT—UNSPORTSMANLIKE T o be unsportsmanlike is to act in a manner unbecoming to the image of professional basketball. It consists of acts of deceit, disrespect of officials and profanity . The penalty for such action is a technical foul. Repeated acts shall result in expulsion from the game and a minimum fine of $2,000. A flagrant foul—penalty (1) is unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent. A flagrant foul—penalty (2) is unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a player against an opponent. It is an unsportsmanlike act and the offender is ejected following confirmation by instant replay review . The offender will be subject to a fine not exceeding $50,000 and/or suspension by the Commissioner. See Rule 12B—Section IV (Roman numeral for 4 (used for sections or rule numbers)) for interpretation and penalties. C. BLOCK-CHARGE A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of a dribbler regardless of his speed and distance. A defensive player is not permitted to move into the path of an offensive player once he has started his upward motion to attempt a field goal or pass. A defensive player must allow a moving player the opportunity to avoid contact when the offensive player receives a pass outside the lower defensive box. The lower defensive box is the area between the 3-foot posted-up marks, the bottom tip of the circle and the endline.",
    "64": "- 64 -A defensive player must allow an airborne player the opportunity to land and then avoid contact when the offensive player is outside the lower defensive box. A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of an offensive player who receives a pass inside the lower defensive box regardless of his speed and distance. A defensive player must allow an airborne player who receives a pass the space to land when the offensive player is inside the lower defensive box. A player must allow a moving opponent without the ball the opportunity to avoid contact if he moves into his path. The speed of the player will determine the amount of distance an opponent must allow . If an offensive player causes contact with a defensive player who has established a legal position, an offensive foul shall be called and no points may be scored. A defensive player may turn slightly to protect himself, but is never allowed to bend over and submarine an opponent. An offensive foul should not be called for charging if the contact is with a secondary defensive player who has established a defensive position within a designated “restricted area” near the basket for the purpose of drawing an offensive foul. The offensive player must take a path directly to the rim. The “restricted area” for this purpose is the area bounded by an arc with a 4-foot radius measured from the center of the basket ring. EXCEPTION (Exception (rule terminology for exceptions)): Any player may be legally positioned within the “restricted area” if the offensive player receives the ball within the Lower Defensive Box. The mere fact that contact occurs on these type of plays, or any other similar play , does not necessarily mean that a personal foul has been committed. The officials must decide whether the contact is negligible and/or incidental, judging each situation separately . An offensive foul shall be assessed if the player initiates contact in a non-basketball manner (leads with his foot, an unnatural extended knee, etc.). D. GAME POSTPONEMENT AND CANCELLA TIONS The decision to postpone or cancel a game can only be made by the League Office, after consultation with the affected teams. Before a game begins, a game may be postponed or cancelled for issues related to the condition of the playing court or arena, or a general or forecasted condition involving weather, travel, civil unrest, natural disaster, or other event. The following factors will be considered in determining whether a game will be postponed or cancelled: (1) The whereabouts of teams and game officials (including the efforts that have been made or can be made to get these participants to the game site). (2) Whether sufficient team and arena staff are available to operate the arena and conduct the game. (3) Input from both teams. (4) The safety of game participants, team and arena staff, and fans. (5) Communications with state or local government officials and law enforcement. (6) The ability to reschedule the game. (7) Any other factor that the NBA (National Basketball Association) deems relevant to the decision. After a game has begun, the decision to postpone or cancel that game will be made using the factors listed above. However, the determiNation of whether to delay the game while the decision is being made is within the authority of the game officials (in consultation with the League Office).",
    "65": "- 65 -E. PHYSICAL CONT ACT—SUSPENSION Any player or coach guilty of intentional physical contact with an official shall automatically be suspended without pay for one game. A fine and/or longer period of suspension will result if circumstances so dictate. F. PROTEST Protests are not permitted during the course of a game. In order to file a protest, the procedure, as set forth in the NBA (National Basketball Association) constitution, is as follows: “In order to protest against or appeal from the result of a game, notice thereof must be given to the Commissioner within forty-eight (48) hours after the conclusion of said game, by e-mail or fax, stating therein the grounds for such protest. No protest may be filed in connection with any game played during the regular season after midnight of the day of the last game of the regular schedule. A protest in connection with a playoff game must be filed not later than midnight of the day of the game protested. A game may be protested only by a Governor, Alternate Governor or Head Coach. The right of protest shall inure not only to the immediately allegedly aggrieved contestants, but to any other member who can show an interest in the grounds of protest and the results that might be attained if the protest were allowed. Each e-mail or fax of protest shall be immediately confirmed by letter and no protest shall be valid unless the letter of confirmation is accompanied by a check in the sum of $10,000 payable to the Association. If the member filing the protest prevails, the $10,000 is to be refunded. If the member does not prevail, the $10,000 is to be forfeited and retained in the Association treasury . “Upon receipt of a protest, the Commissioner shall at once notify the member operating the opposing team in the game protested and require both of said members within five (5) days to file with him such evidence as he may desire bearing upon the issue. The Commissioner shall decide the question raised within five (5) days after receipt of such evidence.” G. SHATTERING BACKBOARDS Any player whose contact with the basket ring or backboard causes the backboard to shatter or makes the ring unplayable will be penalized in the folliwing manner: (1) Pre-game and/or halftime warm-ups—No penalty to be assessed by officials. (2) During the game—non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. Under no circumstances will that player be ejected from the game. The Commissioner will review all actions and plays involved in the shattering of a backboard. H. PLAYER/TEAM CONDUCT AND DRESS (1) Each player when introduced, prior to the game, must be uniformly dressed. (2) Players, coaches and trainers must stand and line up in a dignified posture along the foul lines during the playing of the American and/or Canadian national anthems. (3) The dress code for players has been modified for the 2020-21 NBA (National Basketball Association) season. Players not in uniform (whether on the Active List or Inactive List) are no longer required to wear a sport coat when seated on the bench during games, but such players must wear dress attire that is clean and neat in appearance. “Athleisure” (including, but not limited to, jogger pants, jumpsuits, sweatpants, leggings, etc.) or similar attire is not permitted when seated on the bench during games. (4) While playing, players must keep their uniform shirts tucked into their pants, and no T -shirts are allowed. (5) The only article bearing a commercial ‘logo’ which can be worn by players is their shoes.",
    "66": "- 66 -I. OFFENSIVE 3-SECONDS The offensive player cannot be allowed in the 3-second lane for more than the allotted time. This causes the defensive player to ‘hand-check’ because he cannot control the offensive player for that extended period of time. If the offensive player is in the 3-second lane for less than three seconds and receives the ball, he must make a move toward the hoop for the official to discontinue his three second count. If he attempts to back the defensive player down, attempting to secure a better position in relation to the basket, offensive three seconds or an offensive foul must be called. If he passes off and immediately makes a move out of the lane, there should be no whistle. J. PLAYER CONDUCT—SPECTATORS Any coach, player, trainer, or other team bench person who deliberately enters the spectator stands during the game will be automatically ejected and the incident reported by e-mail to Basketball Operations. Entering the stands to keep a ball in play by a player or the momentum which carries the player into the stands is not considered deliberate. The first row of seats is considered the beginning of the stands. K. FIGHTING Violent acts of any nature on the court will not be tolerated. Players involved in altercations will be ejected, fined and/or suspended. There is absolutely no justification for fighting in an NBA (National Basketball Association) game. The fact that you may feel provoked by another player is not an acceptable excuse. If a player takes it upon himself to retaliate, he can expect to be subject to appropriate penalties. L. EXPIRATION OF TIME NO LESS THAN :00.3 must expire on the game clock and shot clock when a ball is thrown inbounds and then hit instantly out-of-bounds. If less than :00.3 expires in such a situation, the timer will be instructed to deduct A T LEAST :00.3 from the game clock and shot clock. If, in the judgment of the official, the play took longer than :00.3, he will instruct the timer to deduct more time. If :00.3 or less remain on the game clock when thiP situation occurs, the period is over. If :00.3 or less remain on the shot clock when this situation occurs, a shot clock violation is called. The game clock and shot clock must show :00.3 or more in order for a player to secure possession of the ball on a rebound or throw-in to attempt a field goal. Instant replay shall be utilized if the basket is successful on this type of play and the game clock runs to 0:00 or the shot clock expires on a made basket and the officials are not reasonably certain that the ball was released prior to the expiration of the shot clock. The only type of field goal which may be scored if the game clock and shot clock are at :00.2 or :00.1 is a “tip-in” or “high lob.” A “tip-in” is defined as any action in which the ball is deflected, not controlled, by a player and then enters the basket ring. This type of action shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period. A “high lob” is defined as a pass which is tipped by an offensive player while in mid- air, and is followed instantaneously by a field goal attempt. If the reception of the pass and the subsequent “slam dunk” is immediately adjacent to the basket ring, this type of action shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period. However, if the “high lob” attempt is a distance from the basket ring whereby the ball must be controlled in mid-air, either one-handed or two-handed, a minimum of :00.3 is necessary for a field goal to score if successful. Instant replay would NOT be used if the play starts with :00.2 or :00.1 on the game clock or shot clock.",
    "67": "- 67 -NO LESS than :00.3 must expire on the game clock when a player secures possession of an unsuccessful free throw attempt and immediately requests a timeout. If LESS than :00.3 expires in such a circumstance, the time on the game clock shall be reduced by at least :00.3. Therefore, if :00.3 OR LESS remain on the game clock when the above situation exists, and a player requests a timeout upon securing possession of the ball, the period is over. Regardless of when the horn or red light operates to signify the end of period, the officials (as aided by instant replay , if required) will ultimately make the fWnal decision whether to allow or disallow a successful field goal. THE CREW CHIEF MUST T AKE CHARGE OF THE SITUA TION. M. VERBAL F AN INTERFERENCE Any spectator who verbally abuses players and/or coaches in a manner which, in the opinion of the game officials, interferes with the ability of a coach to communicate with his players during the game and/or huddles, will, at the direction of the crew chief, be given one warning by a building security officer. If the same spectator continues to behave in a like manner, the crew chief shall direct a building security officer to eject the spectator from the arena. N. GUIDELINES FOR INFECTION CONTROL In addition to the Health and Safety Protocols for the 2020-21 NBA (National Basketball Association) Season, any subsequent addition or amendments to the Protocols, or the addition of any other health- or safety-related rules established by the NBA (National Basketball Association) in response to COVID-19 pandemic, all NBA (National Basketball Association) team physicians, athletic trainers, equipment managers, and related personnel must comply with the infection control procedures set forth below (in this Section N) in all NBA (National Basketball Association) arenas, locker rooms, training rooms, and practice facilities. If a player suffers a laceration or a wound where bleeding occurs or ifblood is visible on a player or his uniform, the officials shall suspend the game at the earliest appropriate time and allow a maximum of 30 seconds for treatment. After that time, the head coach shall be informed that he has the option to substitute for the player or call a timeout. If a substitute replaces the player, the opposing team shall be allowed to substitute one player. The bleeding player may return to the game when he has received appropriate treatment by medical staff personnel. A team will not be given an additional 30 seconds should the bleeding occur from a wound which reopened, which is not the result of additional contact. If the player returns to the game, the officials shall make certain that any lesion, wound or dermatitis is covered with a dressing that will prevent contamination to and/or from other sources. A wrist or sweat band is not considered a suitable bandage. If the bleeding player is awarded a free throw attempt(s) as a result of a personal foul, or is involved in a jump ball, the bleeding player will be given 30 seconds for treatment. If the treatment is not completed, play will resume and will then be suspended at the first appropriate time. Mandatory timeouts shall not be granted during a suspension of play unless a team is granted a timeout. If treatment is not completed within the allotted time, the head coach may call another timeout or substitute for the bleeding player. Substitutes are permitted consistent with existing rules on substitution. If a team has no timeouts remaining when play is suspended, the officials will allow 30 seconds for appropriate treatment. If the treatment is not completed in accordance with para- graph two above, the bleeding player must be removed immediately. ONL Y the bleeding player on that team may be removed from the game under these circumstances. If so, the opponent may also substitute one player. The offensive team will receive a full eight seconds to advance the ball into the front- court. The shot clock will remain as is or reset to 14, whichever is greater.",
    "68": "- 68 -O. DEAD BALL, LIVE BALL, BALL IS ALIVE After the ball has been dead, it is put into play by ajump ball, throw-in or a free throw attempt. The game clock does not start until the ball is legally touched on the court by a player. However, any floor violation or personal foul which may occur will be penalized. The ball is live when it is given to the thrower-in, free throw shooter or is tossed by the official on a jump ball. Illegal contact, which occurs prior to the ball becoming live, will be ignored if it is not unsportsmanlike or flagrant. The ball is alive when it is legally tapped by one of the participants of a jump ball, released by a thrower-in or released on a free throw attempt that will remain in play . P. TAUNTING If a player blatantly taunts an opponent, a technical foul shall be assessed. The opponent WILL NOT , automatically , be assessed a technical foul. His behavior will be the determining factor. Simultaneous taunting is a verbal altercation. V erbal altercations and unsportsmanlike conduct will be administered as a double technical foul and no free throws will be attempted. T echnical fouls assessed to opposing teams during the same dead ball and prior to the administering of any free throw attempt for the first technical foul, shall be interpreted as a double technical foul. A PLAYER(S) GUILTY OF TAUNTING MUST BE SINGLED OUT AND PENALIZED. If a previous unsportsmanlike act has been committed and if this situation is BLA T ANT , a technical foul must be assessed and the guilty player(s) must be ejected. Q. FLlGRANT FOUL CRITERIA 1. The severity of the contact; 2. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate basketball play (e.g., whether a player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul committed during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if other criteria are present, such as recklessness and hard contact to the head); 3. Whether, on a foul committed with a player’s arm or hand, the fouling player wound up and/or followed through after making contact; 4. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g., a blow to the head and a foul committed while a player is in a vulnerable position); 5. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and 6. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation).",

    "83": "NAISMITH MEMORIAL BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME, INC. (PARENT COMPANY ONLY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS _______ 9 1. Description of OrganDzation The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Inc. (“Hall of Fame”) is a not-for-profit organization formed under Internal Revenue Code Secti on 501(c)(3). It operates as a memorial to the originator of basketball and includes a Hall of Fame to honor basketball greats, a museum, and a library in Springfie ld, Massachusetts. Its wholly-owned for profit subsidiary, Springfi eld Riverfront Development Corporation (“SRDC”), was incorporated to develop and manage the re tail/entertainment complex on the Springfield Riverfront. Operations began in October 2002. The complex is inte nded to enhance the museum and attract additi onal visitors. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements, which are presented on the accrual basis of accounting, have been prepared to focus on the Hall of Fame as a whole and to present ba lances and transactions according to the existence or absence of donor-impos ed restrictions. Accordingly, net assets and changes therein are classified as follows: Net assets without donor restriction Net assets that are not restricted by donors or th e donor-imposed restricti ons have expired. Net assets without donor restrictions may be designated for specific purposes by action of the Board of Trustees. Revenues are reported as increases in net assets without donor restrictions unless use of the related assets is limited by donor-imposed restricti ons. Expenses are reported as decreases in net assets without donor restrictions . Gains and losses on i nvestments are reported as increases or decreases in net assets without donor restrictions unless thei r use is restricted by explicit donor stipul ations or law. Net assets with donor restriction Represent net assets which are subject to donor-im posed restrictions whose use is restricted by time and/or purpose. A portion of the Hall of Fame’s net asse ts with donor restrictions are subject to donor-imposed restrictio ns that require the Hall of Fame to use or expend the gifts as specified, based on purpose or passage of time. When donor restrictions e xpire, that is, when a purpose restriction is fulf illed or a time restriction ends, such net assets are reclassified to net assets without donor restri ctions and reported on th e statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Another portion of net assets with donor restrictions stipulates that the corpus of the gifts be maintained in perpetuity. Genera lly, the donors of these assets pe rmit the Hall of Fame to use all or part of the income ear ned on related investments for general or specific purposes.",

Th e Hall of Fame evaluates its revenue contracts with customers (i.e. earned revenue) based on th e five-step model under Topic 606: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) iden tify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. Earned revenue is recognized as services/events are provided. Other income is recognized as it is earned. Gains and losses on investments are reported as incr eases or decreases to net assets without donor restrictions unless their use is re stricted by donor-imposed stipulati on or state law. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no restrict ions on investment income. ContribEtions and Sponsorships Contributions and sponsorships that are restricted by the donor are reported as increases in net assets without donor restrictio ns if the restrictions expire (that is, when a stipulated time restriction ends or purpose restriction is accomplished) in the repor ting period in which the revenue is recognized. Contributions of property and equipm ent are reported as net assets wi th donor restrictions if the donor restricted the use of the property or equipment to a particular program, as ar e contributions of cash restricted to the purchase of prope rty and equipment. Otherwise, donor restrictions on contributions of property and equipment or assets restricted for pur chase of property and equi pment are considered to expire when the assets are placed in service. A ll other donor-restricted cont ributions are reported as increases in net assets with donor restrictions. When a restriction expires, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassifi ed to net assets without donor restrictions and repor ted in the Statement of Activities as net assets released from restrictions. Promises to Give Conditional promises to give are not recognized in the financial st atements until th e conditions are substantially met or explicitly waived by the donor. Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected within one year ar e recorded at net realizable valu e. Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected in more than one year are recorded at fair value, which is measured as the present value of thei r future cash flows. The discounts on t hose amounts are computed using risk- adjusted interest rates applicable to the years in which the promises are rece ived. Amortization of the discounts is included in c ontribution revenue. In the absence of donor stipulations to the contrary, promises with payments due in future periods are restricted to use after the due date.",

Interest does not accrue on any outstanding balances. The Hall of Fame's method for esti mating an allowance for doubtful a ccounts is based on an estimated loss nate applied to the outstand ing balance and adjusted for judgm ental factors including known and inherent risks in the underlying balances, adverse situ ations that may affect the customer’s ability to pay and current economic conditions. For the Hall of Fame's accounts receivable, the allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020 wa s $1,988. Accounts are continuously reviewed and written off only when all collec tion means have been exhausted. Rental Revenue The Hall of Fame rents space in the building for guests to hold various social and business events. Guests enter into an agreement and pay a deposit in order to reserve the space. Deposits received for events to be held subsequent to year-end are included in deferre d revenue. The agreements are cancelable; however, deposits are non -refundable. Revenue from facil ity rental is recognized when the event is held and deposits on cancellations are recognized wh en notified by the guest of the cancellation. Investments Investments are stated at fair value as determined using quoted market values. Investments received as gifts are recorded at fa ir value as of the date of the gift. Realized gains or losses are computed using the average cost method. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of the investme nt securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term would materially affect the amounts reported in the statement of financial position and the statement of activities. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with a definite life are recorded at cost and are amortized ove r their useful lives using the straight line method. Intangible assets with an indefinite life consis ting of the Hall of Fame marketing rights are reviewed annually for impai rment. Management has not identified any impairment.",

Museum Collections The Hall of Fame collects sports memorabilia, library materials and similar assets of basketball related nature. These collections are maintained for public exhibition, education and research purposes. In accordance with the practic es allowed to museums under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, the Hall of Fame ha s elected not to capitalize its collection items and does not record gifts of collection items as revenues in the financial statements. Collections acquired by purchase are expensed in the period acquired. Cont ributed works of art that do not meet the Hall of Fame's definition of collection items are recorded as a component of proper ty, plant and equipment. Purchases of collection items are r ecorded as decreases in net assets without don or restrictions if purchased with assets wit hout donor restrictions and as decreases in net asse ts with donor restrictions if purchased with donor-restricted assets.

Underwater Endowment Funds The Hall of Fame considers a fund to be underwater if the fair value of the fund is less than the sum of (a) the original value of init ial and subsequent gift amounts donated to the fund and (b) any accumulations to the fund that are required to be ma intained in perpetuity in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument. The Hall of Fa me complies with the MA-UPMIFA, an enacted version of UPMIFA, and has interpre ted UPMIFA to permit spending from underwater funds in accordance with the prudent measures required under the law.

Net assets associated with endow ment funds are classified and re ported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed stipulations. In July 2009, Massachusetts enac ted the Uniform Prudent Manageme nt of Institutional Funds Act (“UPMIFA”) which serves as a model act for st ates to modernize thei r laws governing donor restricted endowment funds . The Board of Trustees of the Hall of Fame has interpreted the UPMIFA as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor- restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the Hall of Fame classifies as donor restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subs equent gifts to the permanent endowment, (c) accumulations to the permanent endowme nt made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The donor- restricted endowment fund is classified as such until those amounts are appr opriated for expenditure by the Hall of Fame in a manner consistent with the standard of pruden ce prescribed by UPMIFA. There were no endowments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Functional Allocation of Expenses The cost of performing various ac tivities has been summarized on a functional basis in the statement of activities. The statement of functional expenses presents expenses by function and natural classification. Expenses directly attributable to a specific functional area are reported within that functional area. Indirect expenses that benefit multiple functional areas have been allocated by the Hall of Fame based upon a standard percentage. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statem ents in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure s of contingent assets a nd liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount s of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Fair Value Measurements Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) A ccounting Standards Codifi cation (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, provides a fra mework for reporting fair value. The framework provides a fair value hierar chy that prioritizes the inputs to valu ation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gi ves the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (lev el 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobse rvable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of th e fair value hierarchy are described as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quo ted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that th e Hall of Fame has the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuat ion methodology include:  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabil ities in inactive markets;  Inputs other than quoted pri ces that are observable fo r the asset or liability;  Inputs that are derived prin cipally from or corroborat ed by observable market data by correlation or other means. If the asset or liability has a specified (cont ractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation me thodology are unobservable an d significant to the fair value measurement. The asset or liability's fair value measurement leve l within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of obs ervable inputs and minimize th e use of unobservable inputs. The following are descriptions of th e valuation methodologies used for a ssets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the met hodologies used at December 31, 2021or 2020. Common stocks and fixed income accounts: Valued at the closing pr ice reported on the active market on which the individua l securities are traded.

T hus, financial assets may not be available for general expenditure within one year. As part of the Hall of Fame’s liquidity management, it ha s a policy to structure its financial assets to be available as its general opera tions, liabilities, and other obligations require. In addition, the Hall of Fame invests cash in excess of daily requirements in shor t-term investments. From time to time, the Board designates a portion of any operating sdrplus for particular or future uses. In the event of financial di stress or an immediate liquidity n eed resulting from events outside general operations, the Hall of Fame’s Board may draw upon these Board-designated funds. The Hall of Fame could also draw an additional $350,000 on its line of credit (as further discussed in Note 9), and an additional $2,448,803 can be draw n on the non-revolving line of cred it (see Note 10) to cover a portion of the amounts subject to ex penditures for specified purposes.",

(2) Whether the shooter fouled was attempting a 2-point or 3-point field goal. During the entire game, the review must take place prior to the shooter releasing the first free throw attempt. The Replay Center Official and on-court official(s) may also review the video to determine only the following other matters: (3) Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation or the ball touched out- of-bounds prior to entering the basket or, in the case of a foul, whether the player fouled committed a boundary line violation. For purposes of this review , the Replay Center Official would look only at the position of the player’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the shot or the foul (as applicable). (4) Whether the shot clock expired before the ball left the shooter’s hand or the foul occurred. (5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. g. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(a)(7) above, the Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul will review the video to determine the following issues: (1) Whether time on the shot clock expired before the ball left the shooter’s hand. Prior to the last two minutes bf the 4th period or the last two minutes of any overtime period, the review must take place prior to the end of the next timeout or period break following the basket in question. During the last two minutes of the 4th period or the last two minutes of any overtime period, the review will take place at the next clock stoppage, including immediately upon a successful basket when the clock stops in the last two minutes. If a shot clock violation is not reviewed in accordance with the foregoing timing rules, it may not be reviewed thereafter. (2) Whether a called foul that is not committed on or by a player in the act of shooting occurred prior to the expiration of time on the shot clock. (3) For a called foul that is committed on or by a player in the act of shooting: whether the foul occurred prior to the expiration of time on the shot clock; or (ii) whether the shooter released the ball prior to the expiration of time on the shot clock if the foul occurred after the expiration of time on the shot clock. During the entire game, the review of a foul occurring as the shot clock expires must take place prior to the shooter releasing the first free throw attempt or prior to the subsequent inbounding of the ball. The Replay Center Official and on-court official(s) may also review the video to determine only the following other matters:",

(5) Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation or the ball touched out of bounds prior to entering the basket or, in the case of a foul, whether the player fouled committed a boundary line violation. For purposes of this review, the Replay Center Official would look only at the position of the player’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the shot or the foul (as applicable). (6) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter’s hand or the player was fouled. (7) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. h. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(a)(8) above, the Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul would review the video to deter- mine whether: (1) When the foul was called, the ball is ahead of the tip of the circle in the backcourt, no defender is ahead of the offensive player with the scoring opportunity and that offensive player is in control of the ball or a pass to him has been released. (2) The foul deprived the offensive team of a transition scoring opportunity. (3) The foul was committed prior to the offensive player starting his shooting motion. (4) The foul was caused by the defender’s attempt to intercept or deflect a pass intended for the player with the transition scoring opportunity. (5) Any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. i. If an instant replay review is triggezed in Section I(a)(9) above, the Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul will review the video to determine which player was fouled. The review must take place prior to the first free throw being released. The Officials would not review video to determine which player committed the foul in question. The Replay Center Official and on-court officials may review the video to determine only the following other matters: (1) Whether the shooter fouled was attempting a 2-point or 3-point field goal. (2) Whether the player fouled committed a boundary line violation prior to the foul. For purposes of this review, the official will look only at the position of the player’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the foul. (3) Whether the shot clock expired before the foul occurred. (4) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the player was fouled. (5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. j. If an instant replay review is triggered in Section I(a)(10) above, the Replay Center Official will review the video to determine whether the ball touched the rim, and make any adjustments to the game clock, shot clock, score and possession that are appropriate in accordance with the following: (1) If play has stopped following the offensive team retaining possession (e.g., the offensive team has made a successful field goal, or a violation or foul has been called), the play must be reviewed immediately upon such stoppage of play and: (i) For a successful field goal, the Replay Center Official will time the play to determine whether the field goal was released prior to the expiration of 24 seconds. If the Replay Center Official determines that the ball was released",

If the Replay Center Official determines that the ball was released after the shot clock should have expired, the points will not count and the opposing team will be awarded the ball at the free throw line extended. (ii) For a called foul, the Replay Center Official and official who called the foul will time the play to determine whether the foul occurred prior to the expiration of the shot clock or, in the case of a called foul that is committed on a player in the act of shooting, whether the shooter released the ball prior to the expiration of the shot clock. If the Replay Center Official and official determines that the foul occurred or the ball was released prior to the expiration of the shot clock, the called foul will be upheld. If the Replay Center Official determines that the foul occurred or the ball was released after the expiration of the shot clock, the called foul will be overturned and a shot clock violation assessed. (EXCEPTION (Exception (rule terminology for exceptions)): Flagrant fouls and unsportsmanlike acts and points scored therefrom will not be nullified.) (iii) If the ball is caused to become out-of-bounds by the defensive team or a defensive violation is assessed, the Replay Center Official will time the play to determine how much time should be tn the shot clock or if a shot clock violation should be assessed. (2) If play is continuous (i.e., if there is no stoppage in play following the offensive team retaining possession of the ball), the officials will stop play during the first pause in action prior to any subsequent change of possession. If the Replay Center Official determines following the review that the shot clock is correct (i.e., no adjustment is required), then play will resume from the point of interruption. If the Replay Center Official determines that the shot clock is incorrect, then the shot clock will be reset to the time the ball was possessed by the offensive team following the ball touching (or not touching) the rim, and the game clock will also be reset to reflect the change. The ball will be inbounded on the sideline nearest the spot where the ball was possessed. (3) If play is stopped while neither team is in possession of the ball and the Replay Center Official determines following the review that a shot clock violation has not occurred, then play will resume with a jump ball at center court between any two players in the game. The shot clock and game clock will be adjusted accordingly. (4) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. If an instant replay review for a shot clock adjustment is not reviewed in accordance with the timing rules set forthabove, it may not be reviewed at any point thereafter. The Replay Center Official will have the final ruling on all other scenarios and clock adjustments. k. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(a)(11) above, the Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul will review the video to determine: (1) Whether the defender was inside or outside the restricted area. (2) Whether the defender was in a legal guarding position. (3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. l.

Section III—Replay Review Process a. Except as set forth in Rule 14 below, replay reviews will be triggered by the on-court game officials and Replay Center Official in accordance with the rules set forth in Section I above. The Replay Center Official will determine the final outcome on all replays triggered pursuant to Section I above except Flagrant Fouls and Altercations, which will be decided by the on-court officials, with personnel in the Replay Center playing a supporting role. In all cases, the two game officials will inform both team benches that the play will be reviewed. For replay reviews to be determined by the Replay Center Official, the calling official, and the crew chief at his/her discretion, will go to the scorer’s table and put on the headset to receive the ruling from the Replay Center Official and the other on-court official(s) will prepare the players to return to play. If the ruling is to be made by the on-court officials, the crew chief and a second official will go to the scorer’s table and make the ruling with the assistance of the Replay Center Official. The third official will monitor the benches. b. Replay reviews should be conducted within two minutes. Notwithstanding this general rule, discretion will be used to extend the review period as reasonably necessary under unusual circumstances, such as when the play could lead to an ejection (e.g., flagrant fouls/ penalty 2), technical issues arise with the replay system, the outcome of the replay review requires multiple replay review angles or additional angles are imminent. In addition, replay reviews of Altercations should be concluded within whatever time is reasonably necessary, even if that time period extends beyond two minutes. c. If the replay system is not functioning properly, or not available, the officials will use the nearest courtside broadcast production TV monitor available. d. The Replay Center Official will use the following to make his/her ruling in the order listed below regarding scoring, timing or fouls at the end of any period: (1) Game clock or shot clock on top of backboard (2) LED lights (3) Game clock on the facades of the balcony (4) Game clock on score boards hanging from the ceiling (5) Superimposed TV clocks EXCEPTION (Exception (rule terminology for exceptions)): For clock malfunctions when clocks start early, late or freeze—the Replay Center Official will use the digital clock in the Replay Center to make the final ruling. e. The officials will keep both teams on the court at the end of the second period if replay is being used to determine if a foul was called prior to expiration of the period or if there is any question whether the shooter committed a shot clock violation, 8-second violation or boundary line violation where time may be added to the game clock. f. The officials will keep both teams on the court anytime replay is used at the end yf the fourth period or overtime period. RULE NO. 14—COACH’S CHALLENGE SectionI—Overview a. A head coach may trigger instant replay review of certain events subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this rule. Instant replay review triggered pursuant to this rule shall be referred to as a “Coach’s Challenge” (or “Challenge” for short).",
    "166": "- 59 -b. Each team is entitled to one Challenge throughout the entire game (regardless of whether the Challenge is successful). c. A team may utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of only the following three events: (1) a called personal foul charged to its own team, (2) a called out-of-bounds violation, or (3) a called goaltending or basket interference violation; provided that, in the last two minutes of the fourth period and last two minutes of any overtime, a team is no longer able to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a called goaltending or basket interference violation, as review of these events during these periods will be exclusively triggered by the on-court game officials. NOTE: A Coach’s Challenge is the only mechanism to trigger replay review of out-of- bounds violations at any point during the game. d. Any called foul, violation, or other decision by the game officials not listed in Section I(c) above, or any non-call, is not a challengeable event. For clarity, instant replay review of the following events, among others, may not be triggered by a Challenge: (1) a called personal foul charged to the opposing team, (2) continuation—e.g., whether a defensive foul occurred prior to the offensive player beginning his shooting motion, (3) a Technical Foul or Flagrant Foul, and (4) violations such as traveling, carrying, double dribble, or an offensive or defensive three- seconds. As set forth in Section III(a)(3) below, any aspect related to continuation constitutes a reviewable matter when a called foul is properly challenged, but continuation is not by itself an independent challengeable event. Section II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers))—Procedure to Initiate the Challenge a. To initiate a Challenge, the challenging team must take the following steps in sequence: (1) The challenging team must call a legal timeout immediately after the call in question (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is already underway); (2) The challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for a Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal (i.e., twirling an index finger) toward the game official(s) during the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the timeout was called or, if the timeout was called by a player on the challenging team, the challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for the Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game officials as the game official is notifying the scorekeeper of the timeout; and (3) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging team’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must notify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging. For purposes of this rule only, “immediately” shall mean that a timeout is called prior to the baYl being given to the thrower-in, the ball being given to the free throw shooter, or the ball being tossed on a jump ball, whichever is applicable (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is already underway). b. To initiate a Challenge of an event that immediately preceded a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team, no later than 30 seconds from the start of the timeout (as measured by the timeout clock), the challenging team’s head coach must take the following steps in sequence: (1) Signal for a Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game officials; and (2) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging team’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must notify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging.",
    "167": "- 60 -c. In the event the game officials conference to determine the call on the floor(and, as a result, the final ruling on the play is unknown for a period of time), the window of time within which a team must immediately challenge the call starts after the officials notify the negatively affected team of the final ruling on the play. The negatively affected team’s window to challenge the final ruling on the play ends when the ball is given to the inbounder or free throw shooter, jump-ball is tossed, or 30 seconds after the team has been notified of the final ruling on the play in the event that a mandatory timeout or timeout by the opposing team has been called (whichever is applicable). d. A team loses its opportunity to challenge the prior call if it is called for a delay-of-game after the call in question but prior to calling timeout and simultaneously signaling for a Challenge. e. Once instant replay review is triggered by a valid Challenge, the official will notify the official scorer of the Challenge. The official scorer shall immediately record the Challenge and, once the instant replay review process is complete, the outcome of the Challenge (including whether the Challenge resulted in a loss of one timeout for the challenging team). Section III—Reviewable Matters a. If an instant replay review of a called foul is triggered by a Challenge, the on-court crew chief will review the video to evaluate whether the foul being challenged was correctly called. The on-court crew chief may also review the video to determine only the following other matters: (1) Whether the correct player (including a player on the opposing team) was called for the foul; (2) Whether a different foul proximate to the called foul should have been called; (3) Any aspect related to continAation, including, but not limited to: (a) Whether the foul occurred prior to the offensive player beginning his shooting motion if the foul is committed by a defensive player; (b) Whether a made basket that the on-court game officials counted shall not count because an offensive player committed a violation after the offensive player gathered the ball; and (c) Whether a made basket disallowed by the on-court game officials shall count because the shot constituted legal continuation. (4) Whether a goaltending or basket interference violation occurred on the play; (5) Whether the game clock expired prior to the foul; (6) Whether the shot clock expired prior to the foul; (7) If an offensive player was fouled while in possession of the ball, whether the player who was fouled committed a boundary line violation either just prior to or after the foul; (8) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the player was fouled; and (9) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. NOTE: For purposes of Section III(a)(2) above, the factors that will be considered in determining whether a prior uncalled foul is proximate to the called foul include (1) whether the players involved in the uncalled foul are the same or different players than the ones involved in the called foul under review, (2) the distance between the uncalled foul and the called foul under review, and (3) the time elapsed between the uncalled foul and the called foul under review. b. If an instant replay review of an out-of-bounds violation is triggered by a Challenge, the Replay Center Official will review the video to evaluate whether the out-of-bounds violation was correctly called.",

If an instant replay review of a goaltending or basket interference violation is triggered by a Challenge, the Replay Center Official will review the video to evaluate whether the call on the floor was correct. The Replay Center Official may also review the video to determine only the following other matters: (1) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim, whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation; provided that, for purposes of this review, the Replay Center Official will look only at the position of the shooter’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the shot and the flight of the ball; (2) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim, whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter’s hand; and (3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred. Section IV (Roman numeral for 4 (used for sections or rule numbers))—Replay Review Process a. The on-court crew chief will determine the final outcome when instant replay review of a called foul is triggered by a Challenge, with personnel in the Replay Center playing a supporting rtle. b. The Replay Center Official will determine the final outcome when instant replay review of a called out-of-bounds violation or called goaltending or basket interference violation is triggered by a Challenge. EXCEPTION (Exception (rule terminology for exceptions)): For pre-season or regular season games conducted outside an NBA (National Basketball Association) arena, the on-court crew chief will determine the final outcome of any replay review triggered by a Challenge. c. To overturn a challenged event or to change the outcome of a reviewable matter via a Challenge, there must be clear and conclusive visual evidence that the initial adjudication of that aspect of the play was incorrect. d. Once the instant replay review process is triggered by a Challenge, the on-court crew chief or Replay Center Official (as appropriate) shall arrive at one of two determinations with respect to the call that was challenged: (1) The call stands (i.e., there is not clear and conclusive visual evidence that the call was incorrect); or (2) The call is overturned (i.e., there is clear and conclusive visual evidence that the call was incorrect).",
    "169": "- 62 -Section V—Impact on Timeouts a. If Uhe call subject to review pursuant to a Challenge is not overturned, the Challenge is deemed unsuccessful and the challenging team loses its timeout. b. If the call subject to review pursuant to a Challenge is overturned, the Challenge is deemed successful and the challenging team retains its timeout unless the timeout taken in conjunction with the Challenge initiated a mandatory timeout. If a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge shall only be deemed successful if the called foul is overturned (i.e., not assigned to the player who was originally called for the foul) because the review results in either: (1) No foul assigned to any player (including if the foul was overturned because a reviewable violation occurred prior to the foul); or (2) A foul assigned to a different player (including a different player on the challenging team). If a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge shall be deemed unsuccessful if the foul remains assigned to the player originally called for the foul regardless of whether any other reviewable matters are changed to the challenging team’s benefit. For the sake of clarity, it shall be deemed an unsuccessful Challenge if a called foul is not overturned but changed from a shooting foul (that would have resulted in free throws for the opposing team) to a non-shooting foul (that does not result in free throws for the opposing team). c. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that immediately preceded the challenging team’s mandatory timeout, the challenging team will lose its mandatory timeout (even if the Challenge is successful). If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will only be charged one timeout (i.e., it will not be charged a timeout for both the mandatory timeout and the Challenge). d. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that preceded the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the team that is ultimately charged with the timeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful: (1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout and, notwithstanding that the Challenge coincided with the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout (and, if another mandatory timeout is remaining in the period, the next mandatory timeout will be assigned to the opposing team); and (2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout and the opposing team will be charged with the timeout. e. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event thatpreceded a timeout called by the opposing team, the team that is ultimately charged with the timeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful: (1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout and, notwithstanding that the opposing team initially called the timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout; and (2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout and the opposing team will be charged with the timeout. f. If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event when that team has no remaining timeouts, no Challenge will take place, and that team shall be charged with an excessive timeout, for which the penalty is a Technical Foul.",

Section VI—Resumption of Play If a Challenge results in the call on the floor being overturned following instant replay review, play is resumed at the point of interruption (as defined in Rule 4, Section XIV). For purposes of this rule only, the point of interruption is where the ball is located when the whistle sounds; provided that: (1) If the defensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a defensive foul that occurred after an offensive player started his shooting motion on a successful shot attempt, and the defensive foul itself is overturned after the replay review, the basket shall count (regardless of when the whistle sounded) and the defensive team is awarded the ball fo start the next possession; and (2) If the offensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an out- of-bounds violation that occurred simultaneous to a successful shot attempt by the offensive player and the whistle sounded after the offensive player started his shooting motion, and the out-of-bounds violation is overturned after replay review, the basket shall count and the defensive team is awarded the ball to start the next possession.",
    "171": "- 64 -COMMENTS ON THE RULES I. GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRA TION AND APPLICA TION OF THE RULES Each official should have a definite and clear conception of their overall responsibilities. It is essential for them to know , understand and implement the rules as intended. If all officials possess the same conception, there will be a guaranteed uniformity in the administration of all contests. The restrictions placed upon the player by the rules are intended to create a balance of play, equal opportunity for the defense and the offense, provide reasonable safety and protection for all players and emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom of action of player or team. The purpose of penalties is to compensate a player who has been placed at a disadvantage through an illegal act of an opponent and to restrain players from committing acts which, if ignored, might lead to roughness even though they do not affect the immediate play . II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers)). BASIC PRINCIPLES A. CONTACT SITUATIONS 1. Incidental Contact The mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which is incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a player attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to perform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this position. The hand is considered “part of the ball” when it is in contact with the baln. Therefore, contact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal. 2. Guarding an Opponent In all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires, provided he legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent. If a defensive or offensive player has established a position on the floor and his opponent initiates contact that results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY . During all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed totake a position between his man and the basket. A player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an opponent provided he is not moving directly or obliquely toward his opponent when contact occurs. A player is never permitted to move into the path of an opponent after the opponent has started his upward jumping motion. A player who extends a hand, forearm, shoulder, hip or leg into the path of an opponent and thereby causes contact is not considered to have a legal position in the path of an opponent. A player is entitled to a vertical position even to the extent of jumping straight-up or holding his arms above his shoulders, as in post play or when double-teaming in pressing tactics.",
    "172": "- 65 -Any player who conforms to the above is absolved from responsibility for any contact by an opponent which may dislodge or tend to dislodge such player from the position which he has attained and is maintaining legally. If contact occurs, the officnal must decide whether the contact is incidental or a foul has been committed. 3. Screening When a player screens in front of or at the side of a stationary opponent, he may be as close as he desires providing he does not make contact. His opponent can see him and, there- fore, is expected to detour around the screen. If he screens behind a stationary opponent, the opponent must be able to take a normal step backward without contact. Because the opponent is not expected to see a screener behind him, the player screened is given latitude of movement. The defender must be given an opportunity to change direction and avoid contact with the screener. T o screen a moving opponent, the player must stop soon enough to permit his opponent the opportunity to avoid contact. The distance between the player screening and his opponent will depend upon the speed at which the players are moving. If two opponents are moving in the same direction and path, the player who is behind is responsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow his pace, but he may not move backward or sideward into his opponent. The player in front may or may not have the ball. This situation assumes the two players have been moving in identically the same direction and path before contact. 4. The Dribble If the dribbler’s path is blocked, he is expected to pass or shoot; that is, he should not try to dribble by an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without contact. B. FOULS: FLAGRANT—UNSPORTSMANLIKE T o be unsportsmanlike is to act in a manner unbecoming to the image of professional basketball. It consists of acts of deceit, disrespect of officials and profanity. The penalty for such action is a technical foul. Repeated acts shall result in expulsion from the game and a minimum fine of $2,000. A flagrant foul—penalty (1) is unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent. A flagrant foul—penalty (2) is unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a player against an opponent. It is an unsportsmanlike act and the offender is ejected following confirmation by instant replay review. The offender will be subject to a fine not exceeding $50,000 and/or suspension by the Commissioner. See Rule 12B, Section IV (Roman numeral for 4 (used for sections or rule numbers)) for interpretation and penalties. C. BLOCK-CHARGE A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of a dribbler regardless of his speed and distance. A defensive player is not permitted to move into the path of an offensive player once he has started his upward motion to attempt a field goal or pass. A defensive player must allow a moving player the opportunity to avoid contact when the offensive player receives a pass outside the lower defensive box. The lower defensive box is the area between the 3-foot posted-up marks, the bottom tip of the circle and the endline.",
    "173": "- 66 -A defensive player must allow an airborne player the opportunity to land and then avoid contact when the offensive player is outside the lower defensive box. A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of an offensive player who receives a pass inside the lower defensive box regardless of his speed and distance. A defensive player must allow an airborne player who receives a pass the space to land when the offensive player is inside the lower defensive box. A player must allow a moving opponent without the ball the opportunity to avoid contact if he moves into his path. The speed of the player will determine the amount of distance an opponent must allow . If an offensive player causes contact with a defensive player who has established a legal position, an offensive foul shall be called and no points may be scored. A defensive player may turn slightly to protect himself, but is never allowed to bend over and submarine an opponent. An offensive foul should not be called for charging if the contact is with a secondary defensive player who has established a defensive position within a designated “restricted area” near the basket for the purpose of drawing an offensive foul. The offensive player must take a path directly to the rim. The “restricted area” for this purpose is the area bounded by an arc with a 4-foot radius measured from the center of the basket ring. EXCEPTION (Exception (rule terminology for exceptions)): Any player may be legally positioned within the “restricted area” if the offensive player receives the ball within the Lower Defensive Box. The mere fact that contact occurs on these type of plays, or any other similar play , does not necessarily mean that a personal foul has been committed. The officials must decide whether the contact is negligible and/or incidental, judging each situation separately . An offensive foul shall be assessed if the player initiates contact in a non-basketball manner (leads with his foot, an unnatural extended knee, etc.). D. GAME POSTPONEMENT AND CANCELLA TIONS The decision to postpone or cancel a game can only be made by the League Office, after consultation with the affected teams. Before a game begins, a game may be postponed or cancelled for issues related to the condition of the playing court or arena, or a general or forecasted condition involving weather, travel, civil unrest, natural disaster, or other event. The following factors will be considered in determining whether a game will be postponed or cancelled: (1) The whereabouts of teams and game officials (including the efforts that have been made or can be made to get these participants to the game site). (2) Whether sufficient team and arena staff are available to operate the arena and conduct the game. (3) Input from both teams. (4) The safety of game participants, team and arena staff, and fans. (5) Communications with state or local government officials and law enforcement. (6) The ability to reschedule the game. (7) Any other factor that the NBA (National Basketball Association) deems relevant to the decision. After a game has begun, the decision to postpone or cancel that game will be made using the factors listed above. However, the determination of whether to delay the game while the decision is being made is within the authority of the game officials (in consultation with the League Office).",
    "174": "- 67 -E. PHYSICAL CONT ACT—SUSPENSION Any player or coach guilty of intentional physical contact with an official shall automatically be suspended without pay for one game. A fine and/or longer period of suspension will result if circumstances so dictate. F. PROTEST Protests are not permitted during thecourse of a game. In order to file a protest, the procedure, as set forth in the NBA (National Basketball Association) constitution, is as follows: “In order to protest against or appeal from the result of a game, notice thereof must be given to the Commissioner within forty-eight (48) hours after the conclusion of said game, by e-mail or fax, stating therein the grounds for such protest. No protest may be filed in connection with any game played during the regular season after midnight of the day of the last game of the regular schedule. A protest in connection with a playoff game must be filed not later than midnight of the day of the game protested. A game may be protested only by a Governor, Alternate Governor or Head Coach. The right of protest shall inure not only to the immediately allegedly aggrieved contestants, but to any other member who can show an interest in the grNunds of protest and the results that might be attained if the protest were allowed. Each e-mail or fax of protest shall be immediately confirmed by letter and no protest shall be valid unless the letter of confirmation is accompanied by a check in the sum of $10,000 payable to the Association. If the member filing the protest prevails, the $10,000 is to be refunded. If the member does not prevail, the $10,000 is to be forfeited and retained in the Association treasury. “Upon receipt of a protest, the Commissioner shall at once notify the member operating the opposing team in the game protested and require both of said members within five (5) days to file with him such evidence as he may desire bearing upon the issue. The Commissioner shall decide the question raised within five (5) days after receipt of such evidence.” G. SHATTERING BACKBOARDS Any player whose contact with the basket ring or backboard causes the backboard to shatter or makes the ring unplayable will be penalized in the following manner: (1) Pre-game and/or halftime warm-ups—No penalty to be assessed by officials. (2) During the game—non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. Under no circumstances will that player be ejected from the game. The Commissioner will review all actions and plays involved in the shattering of a backboard. H. PLAYER/TEAM CONDUCT AND DRESS (1) Each player when introduced, prior to the game, must be uniformly dressed. (2) Players, coaches and trainers must stand and line up in a dignified posture along the foul lines during the playing of the American and/or Canadian national anthems. (3) Players not in uniform (whether on the Active List or Inactive List) are not required to wear a sport coat when seated on the bench (in the first or second row) during games, but such players must wear dress attire that is clean and neat in appearance (e.g., league approved team-issued apparel). “Athleisure” (including, but not limited to, jogger pants, jumpsuits, sweatpants, etc.) or similar attire is not permitted when seated on the bench during games (except that, as previously noted, league approved team-issued apparel is permissible). (4) While playing, players must keep their uniform shirts tucked into their pants, and no T -shirts are allowed. (5) The only article bearing a commercial ‘logo’ which can be worn by players is their shoes.",
    "175": "- 68 -I. OFFENSIVE 3-SECONDS The offensive player cannot be allowed in the 3-second lane for more than the allotted time. This causes the defensive player to ‘hand-check’ because he cannot control the offensive player for that extended period of time. If the offensive player is in the 3-second lane for less than three seconds and receives the ball, he must make a move toward the hoop for the official to discontinue his three second count. If he attempts to back the defensive player down, attempting to secure a better position in relation to the basket, offensive three seconds or an offensive foul must be called. If he passes off and immediately makes a move out of the lane, there should be no whistle. J. PLAYER CONDUCT—SPECTATORS Any coach, player, trainer, or other team bench person who deliberately enters the spectator stands during the game will be automatically ejected and the incident reported by e-mail to Basketball Operations. Entering the stands to keep a ball in play by a player or the momentum which carries the player into the stands is not considered deliberate. The first row of seats is considered the beginning of the stands. K. FIGHTING Violent acts of any nature on the court will not be tolerated. Players involved in altercations will be ejected, fined and/or suspended. There is absolutely no justification for fighting in an NBA (National Basketball Association) game. The fact that a player may feel provoked by another person is not an acceptable excuse. If a player takes it upon himself to retaliate, he can expect to be subject to appropriate penalties. L. EXPIRATION OF TIME NO LESS THAN :00.3 must expire on the game clock and shot clock when a ball is thrown inbounds and then hit instantly out-of-bounds. If less than :00.3 expires in such a situation, the timer will be instructed to deduct A T LEAST :00.3 from the game clock and shot clock. If, in the judgment of the official, the play took longer than :00.3, he/she will instruct the timer to deduct more time. If :00.3 or less remain on the game clock when this situation occurs, the period is over. If :00.3 or less remain on the shot clock when this situation occurs, a shot clock violation is called. The game clock and shot clock must show :00.3 or more in order for a player to secure possession of the ball on a rebound or throw-in to attempt a field goal. Instant replay shall be utilized if the basket is successful on this type of play and the game clock runs to 0:00 or the shot clock expires on a made basket and the officials are not reasonably certain that the ball was released prior to the expiration of the shot clock. The only type of field goal which may be scored if the game clock and shot clock are at :00.2 or :00.1 is a “tip-in” or “high lob.” A “tip-in” is defined as any action in which the ball is deflected, not controlled, by a player and then enters the basket ring. This type of action shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period. A “high lob” is defined ay a pass which is tipped by an offensive player while in mid- air, and is followed instantaneously by a field goal attempt. If the reception of the pass and the subsequent “slam dunk” is immediately adjacent to the basket ring, this type of action shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period. However, if the “high lob” attempt is a distance from the basket ring whereby the ball must be controlled in mid-air, either one-handed or two-handed, a minimum of :00.3 is necessary for a field goal to score if successful. Instant replay would NOT be used if the play starts with :00.2 or :00.1 on the game clock or shot clock.",
    "176": "- 69 -NO LESS than :00.3 must expire on the game clock when a player secures possession of an unsuccessful free throw attempt and immediately requests a timeout. If LESS than :00.3 expires in such a circumstance, the time on the game clock shall be reduced by at least :00.3. Therefore, if :00.3 OR LESS remain on the Wame clock when the above situation exists, and a player requests a timeout upon securing possession of the ball, the period is over. Regardless of when the horn or red light operates to signify the end of period, the officials (as aided by instant replay, if required) will ultimately make the final decision whether to allow or disallow a successful field goal. THE CREW CHIEF MUST TAKE CHARGE OF THE SITUA TION. M. VERBAL F AN INTERFERENCE Any spectator who verbally abuses players and/or coaches in a manner which, in the opinion of the game officials, interferes with the ability of a coach to communicate with his players during the game and/or huddles, will, at the direction of the crew chief, be given one warning by a building security officer. If the same spectator continues to behave in a like manner, the crew chief shall direct a building security officer to eject the spectator from the arena. N. GUIDELINES FOR INFECTION CONTROL In addition to the Health and Safety Protocols for the 2022-23 NBA (National Basketball Association) Season, any subsequent addition or amendments to the Protocols, or the addition of any other health- or safety-related rules established by the NBA (National Basketball Association) in response to COVID-19 pandemic, all NBA (National Basketball Association) team physicians, athletic trainers, equipment managers, and related personnel must comply with the infection control procedures set forth below (in this Section N) in all NBA (National Basketball Association) arenas, locker rooms, training rooms, and practice facilities. If a player suffers a laceration or a wound where bleeding occurs or if blood is visible on a player or his uniform, the officials shall suspend the game at the earliest appropriate time and allow a maximum of 30 seconds for treatment. After that time, the head coach shall be informed that he has the option to substitute for the player or call a timeout. If a substitute replaces the player, the opposing team shall be allowed to substitute one player. The bleeding player may return to the game when he has received appropriate treatment by medical staff personnel. A team will not be given an additional 30 seconds should the bleeding occur from a wound which reopened, which is not the result of additional contact. If the player returns to the game, the officials shall make certain that any lesion, wound or dermatitis is covered with a dressing that will prevent contamination to and/or from other sources. A wrist or sweat band is not considered a suitable bandage. If the bleeding player is awarded a free throw attempt(s) as a result of a personal foul, or is involved in a jump ball, the bleeding player will be given 30 seconds for treatment. If the treatment is not completed, play will resume and will then be suspended at the first appropriate time. Mandatory timeouts shall not be granted during a suspension of play unless a team is granted a timeout. If treatment is not completed within the allotted time, the head coach may call another timeout or substitute for the bleeding player. Substitutes are permitted consistent with existing rules on substitution. If a team has no timeouts remaining when play is suspended, the officials will allow 30 seconds for appropriate treatment. If the treatment is not completed in accordance with para- graph two above, the bleeding player must be removed immediately. ONL Y the bleeding player on that team may be removed from the game under these circumstances. If so, the opponent may also substitute one player. The offensive team will receive a full eight seconds to advance the ball into the front- court. The shot clock will remain as is or reset to 14, whichever is greater.",
    "177": "- 70 -O. DEAD BALL, LGVE BALL, BALL IS ALIVE After the ball has been dead, it is put into play by a jump ball, throw-in or a free throw attempt. The game clock does not start until the ball is legally touched on the court by a player. However, any floor violation or personal foul which may occur will be penalized. The ball is live when it is given to the thrower-in, free throw shooter or is tossed by the official on a jump ball. Illegal contact, which occurs prior to the ball becoming live, will be ignored if it is not unsportsmanlike or flagrant. The ball is alive when it is legally tapped by one of the participants of a jump ball, released by a thrower-in or released on a free throw attempt thatwill remain in play . P. TAUNTING If a player blatantly taunts an opponent, a technical foul shall be assessed. The opponent WILL NOT , automatically , be assessed a technical foul. His behavior will be the determining factor. Simultaneous taunting is a verbal altercation. V erbal altercations and unsportsmanlike conduct will be administered as a double technical foul and no free throws will be attempted. T echnical fouls assessed to opposing teams during the same dead ball and prior to the administering of any free throw attempt for the first technical foul, shall be interpreted as a double technical foul. A PLAYER(S) GUILTY OF TAUNTING MUST BE SINGLED OUT AND PENALIZED. If a previous unsportsmanlike act has been committed and if this situation is BLA T ANT , a technical foul must be assessed and the guilty player(s) must be ejected. Q. FLAGRANT FOUL CRITERIA 1. The severity of the contact; 2. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate basketball play (e.g., whether a player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul committed during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if other criteria are present, such as recklessness and hard contact to the head); 3. Whether, on a foul committed with a player’s arm or hand, the fouling player wound up and/or followed through after making contact; 4. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g., a blow to the head and a foul committed while a player is in a vulnerable position); 5. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and 6. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation).",

In all cases, the two game officials will inform both team benches that the play will be reviewed. For replay reviews to be determined by the Replay Center Official, the calling official, and the crew chief at his/her discretion, will go to the scorer’s table and put on the headset to receive the ruling from the Replay Center Official and the other on-court official(s) will prepare the players to return to playr If the ruling is to be made by the on-court officials, the crew chief and a second official will go to the scorer’s table and make the ruling with the assistance of the Replay Center Official. The third official will monitor the benches. b. Replay reviews should be conducted within two minutes. Notwithstanding this general rule, discretion will be used to extend the review period as reasonably necessary under unusual circumstances, such as when the play could lead to an ejection (e.g., flagrant fouls/ penalty 2), technical issues arise with the replay system, the outcome of the replay review requires multiple replay review angles, or additional angles are imminent. In addition, replay reviews of Altercations should be concluded within whatever time is reasonably necessary, even if that time period extends beyond two minutes. c.

Instant replay review triggered pursuant to this rule shall be referred to as a “Coach’s Challenge” (or “Challenge” for short). b. Each team is entitled to one Challenge per game.

A team may utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of only the following three events: (1) a called personal foul charged to its own team, (2) a called out-of-bounds violation, or (3) a called goaltending or basket interference violation; provided that, in the last two minutes of the fourth period and last two minutes of any overtime, a team is no longer able to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a called goaltending or basket interference violation, as review of these events during these periods will be exclusively triggered by the on-court game officials. NOTE: A Coach’s Challenge is the only mechanism to trigger replay review of out-of- bounds violations at any point during the game. d. Any called foul, violation, or other decision by the game officials not listed in Section I(c) above, or any non-call, is not a challengeable event. For clarity, instant replay review of the following events, among others, may notbe triggered by a Challenge: (1) a called personal foul charged to the opposing team, (2) continuation—e.g., whether a defensive foul occurred prior to the offensive player beginning his shooting motion, (3) a Technical Foul or Flagrant Foul, and (4) violations such as traveling, carrying, double dribble, flopping, or an offensive or defensive three-seconds. As set forth in Section III(a)(3) below, any aspect related to continuation constitutes a reviewable matter when a called foul is properly challenged, but continuation is not by itself an independent challengeable event. Section II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers))—Procedure tl Initiate the Challenge a. To initiate a Challenge, the challenging team must take the following steps in sequence: (1) The challenging team must call a legal timeout immediately after the call in question (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is already underway); (2) The challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for a Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal (i.e., twirling an index finger) toward the game official(s) during the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the timeout was called or, if the timeout was called by a player on the challenging team, the challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for the Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game officials as the game official is notifying the scorekeeper of the timeout; and (3) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging team’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must notify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging. For purposes of this rule only, “immediately” shall mean that a timeout is called prior to the ball being given to the thrower-in, the ball being given to the free throw shooter, or the ball being tossed on a jump ball, whichever is applicable (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is already underway). b. To initiate a Challenge of an event that immediately preceded a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team, no later than 30 seconds from the start of the timeout (as measured by the timeout clock), the challenging team’s head coach must take the following steps in sequence:",

In the event the game officials conference to determine the call on the floor (and, as a result, the final ruling on the play is unknown for a period of time), the window of time within which a team must immediately challenge the call starts after the officials notify the negatively affected team of the final ruling on the play. The negatively affected team’s window to challenge the final ruling on the play ends when the ball is given to the inbounder or free throw shooter, jump-ball is tossed, or 30 seconds after the team has been notified of the final ruling on the play in the event that a mandatory timeout or timeout by the opposing team has been called (whichever is applicable). d. A team loses its opportunity to challenge the prior call if it is called for a delay-of-game after the call in question but prior to calling timeout and simultaneously signaling for a Challenge.e. Once instant replay review is triggered by a valid Challenge, the official will notify the official scorer of the Challenge. The official scorer shall immediately record the Challenge and, once the instant replay review process is complete, the outcome of the Challenge (including whether the Challenge resulted in a loss of one timeout for the challenging team).

(4) Whether a goaltending or basket interference violation occurred on the play; (5) Whether the game clock expired prior to the foul; (6) Whether the shot clock expired prior to the foul; (7) If an offensive player was fouled while in possession of the ball, whether the player who was fouled committed a boundary line violation either just prior to or after the foul; (8) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the player was fouled; and (9) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.

If an instant replay review of a goaltending or basket interference violation is triggered by a Challenge, the Replay Center Official will review the video to evaluate whether the call on the floor was correct. The Replay Center Official may also review the video to determine only the following other matters: (1) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim, whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation; provided that, for purposes of this review, the Replay Center Official will look only at the position of the shooter’s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the shot and the flight of the ball; (2) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim, whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter’s hand; and (3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.

Section V—Impact on Timeouts a. If the call subject to review pursuant to a Challenge is not overturned, the Challenge is deemed unsuccessful and the challenging team loses its timeout. b. If the call subject to review pursuant to a team’s first Challenge is overturned, the Challenge is deemed successful and the challenging team retains its timeout unless the timeout taken in conjunction with the Challenge initiated a mandatory timeout, and is awarded a second Challenge. If a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge shall only be deemed successful if the called foul is overturned (i.e., not assigned to the player who was originally called for the foul) because the review results in either: (1) No foul assigned to any player (including if the foul was overturned because a reviewable violation occurred prior to the fouu); or (2) A foul assigned to a different player (including a different player on the challenging team). If a Challenge is utilizedto trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge shall be deemed unsuccessful if the foul remains assigned to the player originally called for the foul regardless of whether any other reviewable matters are changed to the challenging team’s benefit. For the sake of clarity, it shall be deemed an unsuccessful Challenge if a called foul is not overturned but changed from a shooting foul (that would have resulted in free throws for the opposing team) to a non-shooting foul (that does not result in free throws for the opposing team). If a team utilizes its second Challenge, the challenging team will not retain the timeout used to initiate its second Challenge even if the Challenge is successful. c. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that immediately preceded the challenging team’s mandatory timeout, the challenging team will lose its mandatory timeout (even if the Challenge is successful). If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will only be charged one timeout (i.e., it will not be charged a timeout for both the mandatory timeout and the Challenge). d. If a team utilizes its first Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that preceded the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the team that is ultimately charged with the timeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful: (1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout and, notwithstanding that the Challenge coincided with the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout (and, if another mandatory timeout is remaining in the period, the next mandatory timeout will be assigned to the opposing team); and (2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout and the opposing team will be charged with the timeout. If a team utilizes its second Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that preceded the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout (even if the Challenge is successful).",
    "245": "- 64 -e. If a team utilizes its first Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that preceded a timeout called by the opposing team, the team that is ultimately charged with the timeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful: (1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout and, notwithstanding that the opposing team initially called the timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout; and (2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout and the opposing team will be charged with the timeout. If a team utilizes its second Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that preceded a timeout called by the opposing team, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout (even if the Challenge is successful). f. If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event when that team has no remaining timeouts, no Challenge will take place, and tKat team shall be charged with an excessive timeout, for which the penalty is a Technical Foul. g. If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay of an event that may not be reviewed, the team will be charged a timeout but retain its Challenge. Section VI—Resumption of Play If a Challenge results in the call on the floor being overturned following instant replay review, play is resumed at the point of interruption (as defined in Rule 4, Section XIV). For purposes of this rule only, the point of interruption iswhere the ball is located when the whistle sounds; provided that: (1) If the defensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a defensive foul that occurred after an offensive player started his shooting motion on a successful shot attempt, and the defensive foul itself is overturned after the replay review, the basket shall count (regardless of when the whistle sounded) and the defensive team is awarded the ball to start the next possession; and (2) If the offensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an out- of-bounds violation that occurred simultaneous to a successful shot attempt by the offensive player and the whistle sounded after the offensive player started his shooting motion, and the out-of-bounds violation is overturned after replay review, the basket shall count and the defensive team is awarded the ball to start the next possession.",
    "246": "- 65 -COMMENTS ON THm RULES I. GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRA TION AND APPLICA TION OF THE RULES Each official should have a definite and clear conception of their overall responsibilities. It is essential for them to know , understand and implement the rules as intended. If all officials possess the same conception, there will be a guaranteed uniformity in the administration of all contests. The restrictions placed upon the player by the rules are intended to create a balance of play , equal opportunity for the defense and the offense, provide reasonable safety and protection for all players and emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom of action of player or team. The purpose of penalties is to compensate a player who has been placed at a disadvantage through an illegal act of an opponent and to restrain players from committing acts which, if ignored, might lead to roughness even though they do not affect the immediate play . II (Roman numeral for 2 (used for sections or rule numbers)). BASIC PRINCIPLES A. CONTACT SITUATIONS 1. Incidental Contact The mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which is incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a player attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to perform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this position. The hand is considered “part of the ball” when it is in contact with the ball. Therefore, contact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal. 2. Guarding an Opponent In all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires, provided he legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent. If a defensive or offensive player has established a position on the floor and his opponent initiates contact that results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY . During all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must beallowed to take a position between his man and the basket. A player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an opponent provided he is not moving directly or obliquely toward his opponent when contact occurs. A player is never permitted to move into the path of an opponent after the opponent has started his upward jumping motion. A player who extends a hand, forearm, shoulder, hip or leg into the path of an opponent and thereby causes contact is not considered to have a legal position in the path of an opponent. A player is entitled to a vertical position even to the extent of jumping straight-up or holding his arms above his shoulders, as in post play or when double-teaming in pressing tactics.",
    "247": "- 66 -Any player who conforms to the above is absolved from responsibility for any contact by an opponent which may dislodge or tend to dislodge such player from the position which he has attained and is maintaining legally . If contact occurs, the official must decide whether the contact is incinental or a foul has been committed. 3. Screening When a player screens in front of or at the side of a stationary opponent, he may be as close as he desires providing he does not make contact. His opponent can see him and, there- fore, is expected to detour around the screen. If he screens behind a stationary opponent, the opponent must be able to take a normal step backward without contact. Because the opponent is not expected to see a screener behind him, the player screened is given latitude of movement. The defender must be given an opportunity to change direction and avoid contact with the screener. T o screen a moving opponent, the player must stop soon enough to permit his opponent the opportunity to avoid contact. The distance between the player screening and his opponent will depend upon the speed at which the players are moving. If two opponents are moving in the same direction and path, the player who is behind is responsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow his pace, but he may not move backward or sideward into his opponent. The player in front may or may not have the ball. This situation assumes the two players have been moving in identically the same direction and path before contact. 4. The Dribble If the dribbler’s path is blocked, he is expected to pass or shoot; that is, he should not try to dribble by an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without contact. B. FOULS: FLAGRANT—UNSPORTSMANLIKE T o be unsportsmanlike is to act in a manner unbecoming to the image of professional basketball. It consists of acts of deceit, disrespect of officials and profanity . The penalty for such action is a technical foul. Repeated acts shall result in expulsion from the game and a minimum fine of $2,000. A flagrant foul—penalty (1) is unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent. A flagrant foul—penalty (2) is unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a player against an opponent. It is an unsportsmanlike act and the offender is ejected following confirmation by instant replay review . The offender will be subject to a fine not exceeding $100,000 and/or suspension by the Commissioner. See Rule 12B, Section IV (Roman numeral for 4 (used for sections or rule numbers)) for interpretation and penalties. C. BLOCK-CHARGE A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of a dribbler regardless of his speed and distance. A defensive player is not permitted to move into the path of an offensive player once he has started his upward motion to attempt a field goal or pass. A defensive player must allow a moving player the opportunity to avoid contact when the offensive player receives a pass outside the lower defensive box. The lower defensive box is the area between the 3-foot posted-up marks, the bottom tip of the circle and the endline.",
    "248": "- 67 -A defensive player must allow an airborne player the opportunity to land and then avoid contact when the offensive player is outside the lower defensive box. A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of an offensive player who receives a pass inside the lower defensive box regardless of his speed and distance. A defensive player must allow an airborne player who receives a pass the space to land when the offensive player is inside the lower defensive box. A player must allow a moving opponent without the ball the opportunity to avoid contact if he moves into his path. The speed of the player will determine the amount of distance an opponent must allow . If an offensive player causes contact with a defensive player who has established a legal position, an offensive foul shall be called and no points may be scored. A defensive player may turn slightly to protect himself, but is never allowed to bend over and submarine an opponent. An offensive foul should not be called for charging if the contact is with a secondary defensiveplayer who has established a defensive position within a designated “restricted area” near the basket for the purpose of drawing an offensive foul. The offensive player must take a path directly to the rim. The “restricted area” for this purpose is the area bounded by an arc with a 4-foot radius measured from the center of the basket ring. EXCEPTION (Exception (rule terminology for exceptions)): Any player may be legally positioned within the “restricted area” if the offensive player receives the ball within the Lower Defensive Box. The mere fact that contact occurs on these type of plays, or any other similar play , does not necessarily mean that a personal foul has been committed. The officials must decide whether the contact is negligible and/or incidental, judging each situation separately . An offensive foul shall be assessed if the player initiates contact in a non-basketball manner (leads with his foot, an unnatural extended knee, etc.). D. GAME POSTPONEMENT AND CANCELLA TIONS Whether made before a game begins or after a game has begun, the decision to postpone or cancel a game can only be made by the League Office, after consultation with the affecteO teams. The NBA (National Basketball Association) may postpone or cancel a game before the game begins or after the game has begun for issues related to the condition of the playing court or arena, or a general or forecasted condition involving weather, travel, civil unrest, natural disaster, public and/or player and staff health and safety, or another unusual situation. The factors that the NBA (National Basketball Association) may consider in determining whether to postpone or cancel a game include: (1) The whereabouts of teams and game officials (including the efforts that have been made or can be made to get these participants to the game site). (2) Whether sufficient team and arena staff are available to operate the arena and conduct the game. (3) Input from both teams. (4) The health, safety, and well-being of game participants, team and arena staff, and fans. (5) Input from health, facilities, security, or other experts, when appropriate. (6) Input from players involved. (7) Communications with and/or mandates by state or local government officials and law enforcement.",
    "249": "- 68 -(8) The ability to reschedule the game, including with consideration for impact to the league-wide schedule, competitive fairness, and league and team business opportunities. (9) Any other factor that the NBA (National Basketball Association) deems relevant to the decision. In the event of a situation that arises after a game has begun, the game officials have the authority to decide whether to temporarily delay the game while the decision to postpone or cancel is being made by the NBA (National Basketball Association). E. PHYSICAL CONT ACT—SUSPENSION Any player or coach guilty of intentional physical contact with an official shall automatically be suspended without pay for one game. A fine and/or longer period of suspension will result if circumstances so dictate. F. PROTEST Protests are not permitted during the course of a game. In order to file a protest, the procedure, as set forth in the NBA (National Basketball Association) Constitution, is as follows: “In order to protest against or appeal from the result of a game, notice thereof must be given to the Commissioner within forty- eight (48) hours after the conclusion of said game, by a Writing, stating therein the grounds for such protest. No protest may be filed in connection with any game played during the Regular Season after midnight of the day of the last game of the regular schedule, or, for a game played on the last day of the Regular Season, more than ten (10) hours following the game’s conclusion. A protest in connection with a playoff game must be filed not later than ten (10) hours following the game’s conclusion. A game may be protest may only be filed by a Governor, Alternate Governor, General Manager, or Head Coach. The right of protest shall inure not only to the immediately allegedly aggrieved contestants, but to any other Member who can show an interest in the grounds of protest and the results that might be attained if the protest were allowed. No protest shall be valid unless the Written Notice to the Commissioner thereof is accompanied by a payment in the sum of $25,000 (the “Protest Fee”) payable to the Association. If the Member filing the protest prevails, the Protest Fee is to be refunded. If the Member does not prevail, the Protest Fee is to be forfeited and retained in the Association treasury. “Upon receipt of a protest, the Commissioner shall at once notify the Member operating the opposing team in the game protested and require both of said members within five (5) days to file with him such evidence as he may desire bearing upon the issue. The Commissioner shall decide the question raised within five (5) days after such evidence is due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a protest in connection with a Playoff Game or any other situation where greater expedition is required, the filing of evidence by Members and the Commissioner’s decision of the question raised each shall occur on a schedule as determined by the Commissioner.” G. SHATTERING BACKBOARDS Any player whose contact with the basket ring or backboard causes the backboard to shatter or makes the ring unplayable will be Aenalized in the following manner: (1) Pre-game and/or halftime warm-ups—No penalty to be assessed by officials. (2) During the game—non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. Under no circumstances will that player be ejected from the game. The Commissioner will review all actions and plays involved in the shattering of a backboard. H. PLAYER/TEAM CONDUCT AND DRESS (1) Each player when introduced, prior to the game, must be uniformly dressed. (2) Players, coaches and trainers must stand and line up in a dignified posture along the foul lines during the playing of the American and/or Canadian national anthems.",
    "250": "- 69 -(3) Players not in uniform (whether on the Active List or Inactive List) must wear dress attire that is clean and neat in appearance (e.g., league approved team-issued apparel). “Athleisure” (including, but not limited to, jogger pants, jumpsuits, sweatpants, etc.) or similar attire is not permitted when seated on the bench during games (except that, as previously noted, league approved team-issued apparel is permissible). (4) While playing, players must keep their uniform shirts tucked into their pants, and no T -shirts are allowed. (5) The only article bearing a commercial ‘logo’ which can be worn by players is their shoes. I. OFFENSIVE THREE-SECONDS The offensive player cannot be allowed in the three-second lane for more than the allotted time. This causes the defensive player to ‘hand-check’ because he cannot control the offensive player for that extended period of time. If the offensive player is in the three-second lane for less than three seconds and receives the ball, he must make a move toward the hoop for the official to discontinue his three second count. If he attempts to back the defensive player down, attempting to secure a better position in relation to the basket, offensive three seconds or an offensive foul must be called. If he passes off and immediately makes a move out of the lane, there should be no whistle. J. PLAYER CONDUCT—SPECTATORS Any coach, player, trainer, or other team bench person who deliberately enters the spectator stands during the game will be automatically ejected and the incident reported by e-mail to Basketball Operations. Entering the stands to keep a ball in play by a player or the momentum which carries the player into the stands is not considered deliberate. The first row of seats is considered the beginning of the stands. K. FIGHTING Violent acts of any nature on the court will not be tolerated. Players involved in altercations will be ejected, fined and/or suspended. There is absolutely no justification for fighting in an NBA (National Basketball Association) game. The fact that a player may feel provoked by another person is not an acceptable excuse. If a player takes it upon himself to retaliate, he can expect to be subject to appropriate penalties. L. EXPIRATION OF TIME NO LESS THAN :00.3 must expire on the game clock and shot clock when a ball is thrown inbounds and then hit instantly out-of-bounds. If less than :00.3 expires in such a situation, the timer will be instructed to deduct A T LEAST :00.3 from the game clock and shot clock. If, in the judgment of the official, the play took longer than :00.3, he/she will instruct the timer to deduct more time. If :00.3 or less remain on the game clock when this situation occurs, the period is over. If :00.3 or less remain on the shot clock when this situation occurs, a shot clock violation is called. The game clock and shot clock must show :00.3 or more in order for a player to secure possession of the ball on a rebound or throw-in to attempt a field goal. Instant replay shall be utilized if the basket is successful on this type of play and the game clock runs to 0:00 or the shot clock expires on a made basket and the officials are not reasonably certain that the ball was released prior to the expiration of the shot clock. The only type of field goal which may be scored if the game clock and shot clock are at :00.2 or :00.1 is a “tip-in” or “high lob.” A “tip-in” is defined as any action in which the ball is deflected, not controlled, by a player and then enters the basket ring. This type of actEon shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period.",
    "251": "- 70 -A “high lob” is defined as a pass which is tipped by an offensive player while in mid- air, and is followed instantaneously by a field goal attempt. If the reception of the pass and the subsequent “slam dunk” is immediately adjacent to the basket ring, this type of action shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period. However, if the “high lob” attempt is a distance from the basket ring whereby the ball must be controlled in mid-air, either one- handed or two-handed, a minimum of :00.3 is necessary for a field goal to score if successful. Instant replay would NOT be used if the play starts with :00.2 or :00.1 on the game clock or shot clock.NO LESS than :00.3 must expire on the game clock when a player secures possession of an unsuccessful free throw attempt and immediately requests a timeout. If LESS than :00.3 expires in such a circumstance, the time on the game clock shall be reduced by at least :00.3. Therefore, if :00.3 OR LESS remain on the game clock when the above situation exists, and a player requests a timeout upon securing possession of the ball, the period is over. Regardless of when the horn or red light operates to signify the end of period, the officials (as aided by instant replay , if required) will ultimately make the final decision whether to allow or disallow a successful field goal. THE CREW CHIEF MUST T AKE CHARGE OF THE SITUA TION. M. VERBAL F AN INTERFERENCE Any spectator who verbally abuses players and/or coaches in a manner which, in the opinion of the game officials, interferes with the ability of a coach to communicate with his players during the game and/or huddles, will, at the direction of the crew chief, be given one warning by a building security officer. If the same spectator continues to behave in a like manner, the crew chief shall direct a building security officer to eject the spectator from the arena. N. GUIDELINES FOR INFECTION CONTROL In addition to any health- or safety-related rules established by the NBA (National Basketball Association), all NBA (National Basketball Association) team physicians, athletic trainers, equipment managers, and related personnel must comply with the infection control procedures set forth below (in this Section N) in all NBA (National Basketball Association) arenas, locker rooms, training rooms, and practice facilities. If a player suffers a laceration or a wound where bleeding occurs or if blood is visible on a player or his uniform, the officials shall suspend the game at the earliest appropriate time and allow a maximum of 30 seconds for treatment. After that time, the head coach shall be informed that he has the option to substitute for the player or call a timeout. If a substitute replaces the player, the opposing team shall be allowed to substitute one player. The bleeding player may return to the game when he has received appropriate treatment by medical staff personnel. A team will not be giqen an additional 30 seconds should the bleeding occur from a wound which reopened, which is not the result of additional contact. If the player returns to the game, the officials shall make certain that any lesion, wound or dermatitis is covered with a dressing that will prevent contamination to and/or from other sources. A wrist or sweat band is not considered a suitable bandage. If the bleeding player is awarded a free throw attempt(s) as a result of a personal foul, or is involved in a jump ball, the bleeding player will be given 30 seconds for treatment. If the treatment is not completed, play will resume and will then be suspended at the first appropriate time. Mandatory timeouts shall not be granted during a suspension of play unless a team is granted a timeout. If treatment is not completed within the allotted time, the head coach may call another timeout or substitute for the bleeding player. Substitutes are permitted consistent with existing rules on substitution.",
    "252": "- 71 -If a team has no timeouts remaining when play is suspended, the officials will allow 30 seconds for appropriate treatment. If the treatment is not completed in accordance with para- graph two above, the bleeding player must be removed immediately. ONL Y the bleeding player on that team may be removed from the game under these circumstances. If so, the opponent may also substitute one player. The offensive team will receive a full eight seconds to advance the ball into the front- court. The shot clock will remain as is or reset to 14, whichever is greater. O. DEADBALL, LIVE BALL, BALL IS ALIVE After the ball has been dead, it is put into play by a jump ball, throw-in or a free throw attempt. The game clock does not start until the ball is legally touched on the court by a player. However, any floor violation or personal foul which may occur will be penalized. The ball is live when it is given to the thrower-in, free throw shooter or is tossed by the official on a jump ball. Illegal contact, which odcurs prior to the ball becoming live, will be ignored if it is not unsportsmanlike or flagrant. The ball is alive when it is legally tapped by one of the participants of a jump ball, released by a thrower-in or released on a free throw attempt that will remain in play . P. TAUNTING If a player blatantly taunts an opponent, a technical foul shall be assessed. The opponent WILL NOT , automatically , be assessed a technical foul. His behavior will be the determining factor. Simultaneous taunting is a verbal altercation. V erbal altercations and unsportsmanlike conduct will be administered as a double technical foul and no free throws will be attempted. T echnical fouls assessed to opposing teams during the same dead ball and prior to the administering of any free throw attempt for the first technical foul, shall be interpreted as a double technical foul. A PLAYER(S) GUILTY OF TAUNTING MUST BE SINGLED OUT AND PENALIZED. If a previous unsportsmanlike act has been committed and if this situation is BLA T ANT , a technical foul must be assessed and the guilty player(s) must be ejected. Q. FLAGRANT FOUL CRITERIA 1. The severity of the contact; 2. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate basketball play (e.g., whether a player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul committed during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if other criteria are present, such as recklessness and hard contact to the head); 3. Whether, on a foul committed with a player’s arm or hand, the fouling player wound up and/or followed through after making contact; 4. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g., a blow to the head and a foul committed while a player is in a vulnerable position); 5. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and 6. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation).",

(3) If, as a result of the existence of a Shortfall Amount for the Distri bution Year and following the procedures described in Sections 12(e)(1) -(2) above, the portion of the Distribution Amount that has not been allocated to Teams is greater than zero (0), such unallocated portion of the Distribution Amount shall then be allocated to each player in proportion to the Adjustment Salary provided for by his Adjustment Contract(s) (as a percentage of Adjusted Total Salaries) for the Distribution Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the portion of the Distribution Amount to be allocated to players pursuant to this Section 12(e)(3) in respect of the Distribution Year exceeds the Aggregate Reduction Amount in respect of such Salary Cap Year, then such excess, rather than being allocated to each player in proportion to the Adjustment Salary provided for by his Adjustment Contract(s), shall be allocated to each player on such proportional basis as may be reasonably determined by the Players Association. Example : Assume (i) as set forth in the Governing Audit Report for the 2024 -25 Salary Cap Year (i.e., the Distribution Year), the 2024-25 Disyribution Amount is $500 million, and (ii) prior to any allocations of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount pursuant to this Section 12(e), there is a 2023 -24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $200 million and a 2024- 25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $400 million, and (iii) the 2024-25 Carryover Interest Rate is five percent (5%).

Because the 2024 -25 Distribution Year is later than the 2023 -24 Salary Cap Year, each Team’s 2023 -24 Team Overage Balance (and hence the 2023 -24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance) would be increased by five percent (5%) (i.e., the 2024 -25 Carryover I nterest Rate).

The 2024-25 Distribution Amount of $500 million is greater than the 2023-24 Aggregate Team O verage Balance of $210 million. Accordingly, $210 million of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount would be allocated to Teams in amounts equal to each Team’s 2023-24 Team Overage Balance. As a result of such allocation, each Team’s 2023-24 Team Overage Balance (and hence the 2023 -24 Aggregate Team Overage BalanceM would be zero (0). The next Salary Cap Year in which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than zero (0) is the 2024 -25Salary Cap Year. The Distribution Year is not later than the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year and thus neither each Team’s 2024 -25 Team Overage Balance nor the 2024 -25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be increased pursuant to Section 12(e)(1)(i) above. The unallocated portion of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount is $290 million ($500 million less the $210 million amount that was allocated in respect of the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year), which is less than the 2024 -25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $400 million. Accordingly, $290 million of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount would be allocated to Teams in proportion to each Team’s 2024 -25 Team Overage Balance. As a result of such allocation, each Team’s 2024 -25 Team Overage Balance would be decreased by its respective allocation of the 2024 -25 Distribution Amount (and hence the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be reduced by $290 million), resulting in a 2024- 25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $110 million ($400 million less the $290 million amount allocated from the 2024-25 Distribution Amount).

Covered Behavior Acts that constitute domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse are prohibited at all times and regardless of where they occur. For purposes of this Policy, “domestic violence” includes, but is not limited to, any actual or attempted violent act that is committed by one party in an intimate or family relationship against another party in that relationship. Such an act may include physical assault or battery, sexual assault, stalking, harassment, or other forms of physical or psychological abuse. It may also include behavior that intimidates, manipulates, humiliates, isolates, frightens, terrorizes, coerces, threatens, injures, or places another person in fear of bodily harm. Domestic violence can be perpetrated by current or former spouses, current or former domestic or same sex partners, persons who are living together or have cohabitated, persons with children in common, persons who have or had an intimate or dating relationship, and family members. Domestic violence can be a single act or a pattern of behavior in a relationship. For purposes of this Policy, “sexual assault” includes, but is not limited to, any actual or attempted sexual contact or act to w hich one party has not consented. Lack of consent is deemed to existwhen a person uses or threatens the use of force, harassment, or any other form of coercion against another. Lack of consent is also deemed to exist when a person is mentally incapable of giving consent, as a result of disability, incapacitation, intoxication, or otherwise. For purposes of this Policy, “child abuse” includes, but is not limited to, any act or failure to act by a parent, caregiver, or adult that results in death,",

Policy Committee The Parties shall establish a joint committee to provide education, support, t reatment, referrals, counseling, and other resources for players, their family members, and others at risk (the “Policy Committee”). The Policy Committee will be comprised of two representatives from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and two representatives from the NBPA (the “Party Representatives”), as well as three independent experts with experience in domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or child abuse (the “Expert Representatives”). All decisions of the Policy Committee shall be made by a majority vote, unless otherwise st ated in this Policy, and shall be final, binding, and unappealable. The Party Representatives shall jointly select the three Expert Representatives to serve on the Policy Committee within 60 days of the issuance of this Policy. There shall be at least one Expert Representative on the Policy Committee at all times with specific expertise in each of the three subject areas ( i.e., domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse). The Expert Representatives will each serve for the duration of this Policy; provided, however, that either the NBA (National Basketball Association) or the NBPA may discharge any of them on an annual basis by serving written notice upon the Expert Representative(s) and upon the other Party within 60 days of the anniversary of the appointment of such person. If an Expert Representative is discharged, the Party Representatives shall jointly select a successor Expert Representative within 30 days of the notice of discharge. In the event that the Party Representatives are unable to agree upon and jointly select any or all of the Expert Representatives within 60 days of the issuance of this Policy or within 30 days of the notice of any discharge of an Expert Representative, the following process will be implemented. Within five days following the deadline to select the Expert Representative(s), the Party Representatives shall exchange lists containing the names and qualifications of three proposed Expert Representatives per open position.

Training and Education The Parties seek to prevent incidents of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse from occurring through educational programs and awareness training. The Policy Committee will implement and oversee all training and educational programs for NBA (National Basketball Association) players that address issues of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child a buse, and shall make all determinations related thereto including, but not limited to, the staffing, content, format, and frequency of such programs. The Policy Committee will annually review such programs to ensure that they are effective and that the co ntent is appropriate, thorough, and properly communicated to the players.

General The NBA (National Basketball Association) or the NBPA may refer a player to the Policy Committee in any of the following circumstances: a. As part of a disciplinary determination of the Commissioner for conduct in violation of this Policy; or b. After a Player is c riminally convicted of an offense that involves conduct in violation of this Policy. The Policy Committee will also be available as a resource to any player who voluntarily seeks assistance. Once a player has been referred to the Policy Committee, an exper t selected by the Policy Committee will conduct an initial evaluation of the player as soon as is practicable. Following such evaluation, the Policy Committee will develop a Treatment and Accountability Plan (“TAP”) for the player, as may be appropriate. As part of the TAP, the Policy Committee may require that the player submit to psychological or other evaluations and/or attend counseling sessions with a licensed professional, and take other steps that it deems necessary. In developing the TAP, the Pol icy Committee will take into account any treatment or counseling that the player may have initiated on his own or pursuant to a criminal resolution of any charges against him. The Policy Committee will oversee the player’s compliance with any TAP, and shal l provide additional support to the player as needed. Any treating professionals shall provide regular, written status reports to the Policy Committee that detail the player’s progress and compliance with the TAP. The Policy Committee may periodically re vise, modify, extend, or close the TAP on its owA initiative, on the recommendation of the player’s treating professional(s), or upon petition of the player. All information related to a player’s involvement with the Policy Committee shall be kept confide ntial.",

A player must receive a certification of completion from the Policy Committee in order to conclude his treatment and the oversight of the Policy Committee. 2. Non-Compliance Players are required to comply with the directives of the Policy Committee, including with his TAP. If the Policy Committee determines that a player has failed to comply without a reas onable explanation, it shall notify the NBA (National Basketball Association). For the first such instance of non- compliance, the NBA (National Basketball Association) shall issue a warning to the player. If such non- compliance continues for three additional days after the warning is issued, or for the second or any additional instances of non- compliance as determined by the Policy Committee, the NBA (National Basketball Association) shall fine the player in the amount of $10,000 for each day that he fails to comply. Such fines shall continue until the player has, in the judgment of the Policy Committee, resumed full compliance. If the Policy Committee determines that a player has demonstrated substantial non- compliance, without a reasonable explanation, through a pattern of behavior that demonstrates a mindful disregard for his treatment responsibilities, it shall notify the NBA (National Basketball Association), which shall thereupon impose: a. A one -game suspension for the first instance of substantial non-compliance; and b. A suspension that is at least one game longer than his immediately -preceding suspension for each additional instance of substantial non- compliance and that shall continue until, in the judgment of the Policy Committee, the player resumes full compliance with its directives, including with his TAP.

The NBA (National Basketball Association)’s share will be excluded from the calculation of Benefits under the CBA. Investigation of Incidents The NBA (National Basketball Association) will give the NBPA and the player prompt notice of the commencement of any investigation into an alleged violation of this Policy. The NBA (National Basketball Association)’s investigation may include the use of thir d party resources including, but not limited to, outside legal counsel, outside investigators, or other individuals with relevant experience ar expertise. The NBA (National Basketball Association) will notify the NBPA when it has concluded its investigation and report whether it believes a violation of the Policy has occurred. Cooperation Except in circumstances where the player has a reasonable apprehension of criminal prosecution, players shall cooperate fully with any NBA (National Basketball Association) investigation under this Policy. Any player interviewed by the NB A as part of its investigation is entitled to have a representative from the NBPA present during the interview, and the NBA (National Basketball Association) will provide the NBPA with at least 48 hours’ notice before any in -person interview. Failing to cooperate in full, or interfering in any manner, with an NBA (National Basketball Association) investigation will subject the non- cooperative individual to discipline consistent with the terms of Article VI, Section 11(a) of the CBA. It may constitute a violation of this cooperation requirement for a player to attempt to or enter into any agreement with a witness, victim, or other party that would discourage or prevent that individual from cooperating with an NBA (National Basketball Association) investigation.

The parties agree that administrative leave is not intended to be routinely applied during the pendency of every player investigation under this Policy. Instead, administrative leave should be applied in only those cases in which a balancing of all relevant factors clearly establishes that it is reaso nable to do so under the totality of the circumstances. In deciding whether to place a player on paid administrative leave, the Commissioner shall consider among other relevant factors the following non-exhaustive list of factors: • The nature and severity o f the allegation(s), including whether a weapon was involved and whether any injury was suffered by anyone (including the player); • Whether the allegations are supported by credible information; • The relationship between the player and accuser; • Information regarding the player’s history of prior similar conduct, or lack thereof; • The prior criminal or disciplinary history of the player, or lack thereof; • The status of any criminal investigation and/or prosecution regarding the alleged incident, including whethe r any arrests have been made; • The character of the player; • The player’s reputation within the NBA (National Basketball Association) community; • The NBA (National Basketball Association)’s past practice regarding discipline imposed on a player for similar allegations; and • The risk of reputational damage to the NBA (National Basketball Association) and/or the player’s team.

While on administrative leave, the player shall be ineligible to play in any of his team’s games. However, the player will continue to receive his salary and other welfare benefits to which he would be entitled as an active player. The player and the player’s team may also request that the player be allowed to participate in non- public practices, workouts, or other team activities with the consent of the NBA (National Basketball Association), which shall not be unreasonably withheld. A player may challenge the decision to be placed on paid administrative leave under the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure of the CBA. In evaluating such a challenge, the Grievance Arbitrator will determine whether it was reasonable for the Commissioner to place the player on administrative leave. A player may also request the Grievance Arbitrator review the length of a period of administrative leave that exce eds seven days. In such a proceeding, the Grievance Arbitrator will determine whether administrative leave in excess of seven days is reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Once a player challenges the decision to be placed on paid admini strative leave, or the duration of such leave, the hearing before the Grievance Arbitrator must take place within 72 hours. Discipline Based on a finding of just cause, the Commissioner may fine, suspend, or dismiss and disqualify from any further association wiEh the NBA (National Basketball Association) and its teams a player who engages in prohibited conduct in violation of this Policy. Repeat offenders will be subject to enhanced discipline. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an admission to, or conviction for, any offense that inv olves conduct that violates this Policy, whether after trial or upon a plea of guilty, as well as any plea of no contest or nolo contendere, will conclusively establish a violation of this Policy. A violation based on this ground, however, shall in no way limit or prevent the NBA (National Basketball Association) from continuing to investigate the incident. Additionally, such admission, conviction, or plea is not required in order for a Policy violation to have occurred. However, a player who isacquitted after trial in a criminal proceeding may not be subject to disciplinary penalties under this Policy.",

Any discipline determined by the Commissioner may be referred to the player’s team for impos ition. Prior to the determination of any discipline, the Parties shall meet to discuss the matter. This conference shall be considered confidential, and no statements made during the discussion shall be admissible in any subsequent challenge to any discip line imposed on the player. The Commissioner will determine all discipline under this Policy on a case-by-case basis, upon consideration of all facts and circumstances, including aggravating and mitigating factors. Potential aggravating factors include, bu t are not limited to: • Prior allegations of, or convictions for, prohibited conduct; • The use of a weapon or other means of coercion; • The use of, or threat to use, force or violence; • The vulnerability of the victim; • The presence of a minor; • The nature and extent of any injury tothe victim; and • A civil verdict against the player for the underlying conduct. Potential mitigating factors include, but are not limited to: • Acceptance oj responsibility; • Evidence of self -defense; • Complete and truthful cooperation w ith the investigation; • Voluntary participation in any treatment or counseling programs; • The player’s overall good character; • The player’s reputation in the NBA (National Basketball Association) community; and • A civil verdict in favor of the player for the underlying conduct.",

Confidentiality The Parties recognize the importance of confidentiality and privacy to the success of this Policy. Accord ingly, the Parties will maintain confidentiality throughout the investigatory, disciplinary, and treatment process, and will Bake reasonable measures to protect the information gathered pursuant to this Policy, including by any outside advisors or experts.
